It is with great pleasure that I forward this message on the occasion
of the Undergraduate Research Symposium (FAuRS - 2021/22) of
the Faculty of Agriculture. I'd like to greet and thank all of the
undergraduates who are attending this symposium.
It has been known for a long time that science and technology must
help agriculture grow. This notion facilitated the transformation of
traditional agriculture into industrial agriculture. In the last decades of the 20th century,
national and international research institutes focused on agriculture helped speed up the
change. Sri Lanka is no exception.
Even though agricultural innovation and the use of technology have gotten better in Sri
Lanka over the years, less attention has been paid to the agricultural transformation that
focuses on how science, agriculture, and society all work together. As a comprehensive
university, the University of Peradeniya has everything needed to undertake research in
a way that draws on many different fields.
Undergraduates who undertake research advance their ability to learn, think critically,
and solve problems. Furthermore, the ability to communicate is an important attribute of
a university’s output. I'm hopeful that this symposium will be a great place for
undergraduates in agriculture to share their research findings with the scientific
community, industry, and policymakers. It will also help them learn how to do research
that will be useful in the future.
I take this opportunity to congratulate the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, the
Coordinator FAuRS, the Organizing Committee, and all other staff for their untiring
efforts in organizing this calendar event.
I wish the FAuRS - 2021/22 a great success.

It gives me great pleasure to provide this message to the FAuRS -
2021/2022 when we plan to celebrate our 75 years of contribution to
the Country's higher education system. The Faculty's journey since
its inception in 1948 has been marked by countless innovations that
have drastically changed the trajectory of the Country's higher
education sector, particularly in the agriculture and allied fields.
Thanks to our forefathers for laying the foundation and creating a
conducive culture that has become a breeding ground for scientific discoveries while
gifting generations of scientists to society with an excellent aptitude for engaging in
research, development and outreach.
A significant milestone of the Faculty was introducing the research component to the
undergraduate curriculum in 1975, which allowed undergraduates to sharpen their
research skills while grooming them as young scientists. Since then, a few academic
Departments have organized research symposia at departmental levels to communicate
student research findings, culminating in a faculty-wide undergraduate research
symposium, i.e. the Faculty of Agriculture Undergraduate Research Symposium
(FAuRS) in 2014. Since then, FAuRS has become a key event in the Faculty's calendar.
FAuRS provides the Faculty's final-year students with a platform to showcase their
research findings and helps them develop their confidence through engaging in numerous
healthy competitions and sharpening their organizing skills by volunteering to be a part
of the FAuRS organizing committee. The FAuRS - 2021/2022 has taken a novel step
forward to widen its scope of student engagements by opening some contests to students
of other local and foreign universities to further challenge our students and to make them
more attuned to future challenges.
As the dean of the Faculty, I take this opportunity to congratulate the FAuRS coordinator
and the Organizing Committee for making the FAuRS - 2021/2022 a great success amidst
numerous challenges imposed by the Country's ongoing economic crisis situation. While
inviting you to witness the talents of our students, I wish you all a Prosperous 2023 and
a Happy Diamond Jubilee Year!

On behalf of the organizing committee, it is my great pleasure to
provide this message to the Faculty of Agriculture Undergraduate
Research Symposium 2021/22 (FAuRS - 2021/22). Over the years,
the undergraduate Research Symposium has gradually evolved into
being the main glamorous event of the Faculty of Agriculture and
has become a main event of the annual calendar of the Faculty. This
year we are organizing FAuRS for the 8th consecutive time.
The FAuRS provides a platform for the final year undergraduate students of the Faculty,
to blend with the local and international professionals and students, and showcase their
talents while improving knowledge, skills and attitudes during the process. We have lined
up a series of exciting activities at FAuRS - 2021/22 that will allow our students to reflect
upon and celebrate their accomplishments, explore born and learned talents, extend their
networks, and jointly explore current and future research directions. As the Faculty, we
expect that this symposium will set stage to improve themselves, build professional
linkages, impress potential employers and exchange ideas on how to chart their journey
forward to reach new heights.
Agriculture has gained unprecedented prominence than ever today due to the necessity
of assuring food security of the nation amidst many challenges presented by climate
change, socio-political instabilities, fuel crisis, pandemics and natural disasters, etc.
around the world. As the pioneer in Agriculture higher education and research in Sri
Lanka, the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, is very much concerned
about the connection between tertiary agricultural education and the needs of the country.
Thus, FAuRS - 2021/22 will receive much attention from the local and international
professional bodies, industry, government authorities and the general public.
I am confident that the FAuRS - 2021/22 will fulfill the expectation of the Faculty of
Agriculture. I wish all the students who are taking part in FAuRS - 2021/22 all the success
in their future endeavors.

A Comparison of Productive and Reproductive Performance of Jersey and
Jersey×Friesian Crossbred Cows of a Large Scale Dairy Farm in the Dry
Zone, Sri Lanka

Productive and reproductive performances are the economically most important
parameters of dairy cattle industry. Breed performance comparison studies help to
determine the most suitable genotypes for different conditions. This study was
undertaken to compare the productive and reproductive performances of Jersey and
Jersey×Friesian crossbred cows in an intensively managed dairy herd in the dry zone of
Sri Lanka. Lactation length (LL), lactation milk yield (LY),305 days milk yield (305Y),
daily average milk yield (DY), peak milk yield (PMY) and peak day (PD) were the
productive parameters considered while services per conception (SPC), age at first
calving (AFC), calving interval (CI), percentages of stillbirths (SB), percentage of
abortions (AB) were collected as reproductive parameters from 924 cows (Jersey: n=342
and Jersey×Friesian crosses: n= 582).The means of different parameters for each breed
were compared using a t-test and frequency data were compared using chi square test in
the R programme and also SPC was analysed using Mann-Whitney U test in SPSS. The
mean 305Y and LY of Jersey×Friesian crossbred cows (3560.77±1807.01L and
4347.93±1854.40L. respectively) were significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater than Jersey cows
(3231.26±1534.05L and 3937.92.94±1491.87L respectively). Jersey×Friesian crossbred
cows showed a significantly (p&lt;0.05) longer LL compared to Jersey cows
(386.44±115.38 days vs. 368.15±102.46days, respectively). The highest DY was given
by Jersey×Friesian crossbred cows (11.44±3.71L.) compared to Jersey cows
(10.46±3.33L.) and also the mean PMY of Jersey×Friesian crossbred cows
(22.76±5.45L) were significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater than Jersey cows (21.10±3.96L).
Jersey cows had a significantly (p&lt;0.05) shorter calving interval (495.40±134.70 days)
compared to Jersey×Friesian crossbred cows (513.35±136.58 days). Furthermore, PD,
SPC, AFC, AB%, and SB% were not significantly (p&lt;0.05) different between the two
breeds. In conclusion, Jersey×Friesian crossbred cows seem to produce more milk but
their calving interval is longer compared to Jersey cows. Thus, Jersey×Friesian crossbred
cows showed better productive performance in the Dry zone.

A Review of Cerebrospinal Nematodiasis in Goats Caused by Setaria
digitata
Nethmini A.K.T.S. and Wijayagunawardane M.P.B.*
Department of Animal science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Among filarial worms, the Setaria is a heteroxenic parasite that lives in the peritoneal
cavity of bovines as definitive host and theinvertebrate mosquitoactasthe
intermediate host. These microfilariae, in turn taken up by mosquito species such as
Aedes, Anopheles, Culex during blood feeding, and grow them to the infective stages.
However, when the erratic larvae enter in to an intermediate host, such as goats, the larvae
may migrate along the nerves, and cause substantial damage the central nervous system
(CNS). Cerebrospinal nematodiasis is results from aberrant migration of nematode larvae
within the spinal cord of many ruminant species. Laval migration in CNS in neurological
system and host immune response elevate the intensity of clinical disease indirectly by
toxins or unknown methods. Symptoms includes complete or incomplete posterior
paralysis, reduced cutaneous sensation, proprioceptive deficits as well as cranial nerve
reflexes deficits. Diagnosis is based on the detection of microfilariae in blood which can
be confirmed by stained blood smears. Many ordinary anthelmintics are not effective
against adults or larvae of Setaria. Some reports indicates that some macrocyclic lactone
are partially effective against microfilariae of certain Setaria species. Biological control
of Setaria worms is currently not practicable. Although antifilarial drugs are effective for
circulatory larval stage they are not effective in CNS because drugs cannot cross blood
brain barrier. Although it may be feasible against mosquitoes control in some areas. A
key preventative measure to prevent or at least to reduce cattle infestation with Setaria
worms by controlling the mosquito bites.

Assessing Morphological Responses of Greenhouse Tomatoes to Varying
Nitrogen Levels using Manual and Image-Sensing Methods
Bandara R.M.D.M., Weerakkody W.A.P.* and Bandaranayake P.1
Department of Crop Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Protected agriculture (PA) is a solution for overcoming conventional agriculture issues
and thus for feeding the rising world population. Hence soilless culture has become an
integral part of PA and managing plant nutrition in PA is important. Therefore, innovative
intellective diagnostic systems for diagnosing nutrient deficiency symptoms are a timely
need. Hence this experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of “image sensing”
as a diagnostic tool for nitrogen deficiency in a fully intensive greenhouse located in
WM2b (Mid-country Wet zone). Study was conducted to detect growth response of
tomato, variety ‘Sylviana’ to varying nitrogen levels using manual and image sensing
methods. In this study, five nitrogen fertilization levels were established. Of them, T1
was 200% N of the recommendation, T2 (control) was 100% N, and T3, T4, and T5 with
50%, 25%, and 12.5 % N levels respectively. The results showed that stem thickness, leaf
area, plant height, and leaf number were significantly different within treatments
(p&lt;0.05) after 5th weeks after transplanting (WAP). At 7WAT, the leaf dry weight was
significantly different between T2, T3, T4, and T5. For detecting leaf color, leaf images
were processed in “ImageJ software” to determine the green color intensity. Image
analysis results showed that there was a significant difference among treatments since
the 3rd WAT. The option of “use of Leaf color chart” for this purpose was found less
effective. According to the results, diagnosis of N deficiency in tomato leaves could be
effectively done with the use of image sensing much earlier without waiting for
morphological changes. The positive results found with the image sensing method for
detection of N deficiency of tomatoes would be used to develop an effective and efficient
method for leaf color-based diagnosis of nutrient deficiencies in large-scale cultivations.

Investigations based on segregating populations such as F2 are essential for genome
mapping and QTL analysis of crops. Deriving an F2 population of coconut is difficult due
to the long generation interval. The objectives of the current study were to investigate
two F2 populations of coconut for morphological and molecular segregation and to derive
marker-trait associations. The study was done using 80 individuals of 2 five-year old F2
populations derived from crosses; Red dwarf × Brown dwarf (RDBD) and Green dwarf
× Yellow dwarf (GDYD) planted at Middeniya Research Station, Coconut Research
Institute. The populations were phenotyped considering 16 quantitative and qualitative
parameters, followed by genotyping based on 6 SSR marker loci. Descriptive statistics
were generated for morphological data and genotypic data were analyzed by
Powermarker software. Marker-trait associations were derived by single marker analysis.
High values of standard deviation, variance and range of quantitative traits and the
presence of different categories of qualitative traits indicated high levels of phenotypic
segregation within the populations. Of the 6 SSR loci, only 5 were polymorphic and
revealed 20 alleles in 2 populations reporting 2-6 alleles per marker. Mean values of gene
diversity, heterozygosity and polymorphic information content for RDBD were 0.64,
0.62 and 0.57, while the same for GDYD were 0.60, 0.60 and 0.54, respectively.
Significant associations (P&lt;0.05) were identified for; leaflet number at CnCirB12; petiole
width at CnCirB12 and CnCirE10; number of leaflets at CnCirB12; petiole length at
CnCirC3, CnCirE10; leaflet length at CnCirE10 and pollination behaviour at CnCirG11
marker loci. Accordingly, the two populations were identified to be highly segregating,
facilitating their use in QTL analysis. The revealed marker-trait associations can be used
for parental selection in coconut breeding. Detailed genotyping and phenotyping is
recommended for comprehensive QTL analyses.

Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important soil physical property to determine the land
productivity for successful crop production. There is a growing concern to study the
temporal and spatial variability of SOM in agricultural ecosystems. Kurunegala district
is one of the main areas of paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka. This study assessed the
variability of the SOM content in paddy lands in the Kurunegala district, covering the
three climatic zones (wet, dry and intermediate), eight agro-ecological regions (AERs),
eight soil types, three irrigation systems (major, minor and rainfed), four cropping
patterns (rice-rice, rice-fallow, rice-other field crops, and rice -vegetables), and in 30
Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs). Already collected 902 soil samples from the
paddy lands within the Kurunegala district were used. Loss on ignition (LOI) method
was used to analyze the SOM content. The highest average SOM content was reported
from the paddy lands in WM3b (2.9%) and in immature brown loam soils (4.2%).
Further, the highest average SOM content (3.1%) was reported in the Bingiriya DSD.
There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in SOM in paddy lands in the Kurunegala
district among the three climatic zones, irrigation systems, and the cropping patterns
practiced. However, the SOM content in paddy lands in the Kurunegala district showed
a significant difference (P&lt;0.05) with the soil type, agro-ecological region and the DSD.
The resulted also revealed that the SOM content in most of the paddy soils in Kurunegala
district of Sri Lanka was not at a satisfactory level of 3%. These factors should be
considered in fertilizer application and in other management practices in the paddy lands
within Kurunegala District to improve the soil quality.

Application of Hydrogel and Urea in Paddy Cultivation to Overcome Low
Soil Moisture Stress and to Increase Fertilizer Use Efficiency

Soil moisture is an essential factor for urea hydrolysis and hence, water-limiting
conditions would hinder the uptake of nitrogen by plants. Hydrogel can be used as a
potential solution for this problem due to its ability to absorb significant amounts of
moisture and uniformly release 95% of the stored moisture in dry soil conditions.
Hydrogel can also release soil-dissolved nutrients slowly to the plants. However,
application of urea could lower the efficiency of the hydrogel. Therefore, this study
evaluated the efficacy of application of Hydrogel and urea in paddy cultivation under
water deficit conditions. A pot experiment was conducted using Oryza sativa var. Bg300
as the test plant, in a completely randomized design with 6 replicates under greenhouse
conditions. Treatments T1 and T2 were maintained without Hydrogel but with urea only
(0 and 100% of recommended level, respectively). Treatments T3 to T7 consisted of
Hydrogel incorporated into top 5 cm of soil at 1.5 g/kg soil dry weight, and urea mixed
to the same soil depth at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the recommended level, respectively.
All plants were subjected to moisture stress by complete withholding of irrigation at 25
days after planting (DAP). Plant growth and soil conditions were measured from 4 weeks
after planting (WAP). The highest plant growth was observed in T7 and the lowest in T1.
Nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) was low in T1 and T2 and the highest in T3 (P&lt;0.05).
Similar NUpE was recorded in T4 to T7, which was higher than T1 and T2 but, lower
than T3 (P&lt;0.05). Hydrogel increased soil moisture levels and NUpE of paddy plants
compared to the control, although urea reduced its moisture retention efficiency.
Hydrogel could be an effective tool in conserving soil moisture and increasing NUpE in
paddy cultivation under low moisture conditions.

The influence of inclusion of hybrid Napier (Pennisetum perpureum x P. americarnum
va. CO3), Pureria (Pureria phaseoloides) and Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) on the
quality of maize (Zea maize cv. Veera) silage was assessed. The experiment was
performed as a randomized complete block design with five forage inclusion levels in
maize silage (0%, 27% Napier, 50% Napier, 29% Pureria, 40% Gliricidia) and two
ripening periods (35 days, 45 days). Maize, Napier, Pureria, and Gliricidia had 23.54,
17.06, 18.40, and 27.49dry matter (DM) and 9.73, 8.04, 16.05, and 20.16 percent crude
protein. Experimental silage bales (25 kg, 485-587 kg/m3) were assessed for pH and DM,
lactic acid, soluble carbohydrates, and ammonia nitrogen contents. The level of inclusion
of forage and ripening period significantly (P&lt;0.05) influenced silage quality. The DM
content of 50% Napier included silage was significantly low (17.40% - 19.94%) and thus
is not suitable. A very low level of soluble carbohydrate in Pureria and Gliricidia included
silage at 45 days (0.24% and 0.26%, respectively) is an indication of the completion of
ensiling before 45 days of ripening. Pure maize and 27% Napier included silage took 45
days to achieve the minimum acceptable level (10%) of lactic acid (10.25% and 18.11%,
respectively). Corresponding with the lactic acid level, pure maize and 27% Napier
included silage recorded low (P&lt;0.05) pH at 45 days (3.24% and 3.45%, respectively).
The ammonium nitrogen contents in Pureria and Gliricidia were higher at 45 days (0.327
and 0.132, respectively) probably due to the fermentation by clostridium. The study
recommends the inclusion of Napier, Pureria, and Gliricidia in maize silage at 27%, 29%,
and 40%, respectively. Further, the adoption of 45-day ripening period is beneficial for
pure maize and 27% Napier included silage. However, 29% Pureria and 40% Gliricidia
included silage should be ripened for only 35 days.

Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of Maize cultivation is about 33%, and the remaining 67%
of applied Nitrogen is lost, causing severe monetary loss and environmental pollution.
Different Urea fertilizer rates combined with Urea stabilizers, Bio-char compound
fertilizers, and super absorbent polymers (SAP) have the potential to enhance the NUE.
A field experiment was conducted at the Experimental Station of the University of
Peradeniya at Dodangolla to evaluate the growth and production of maize, Agronomic
NUE (AEN), and Ammonia emission under eight treatment combinations. There were
four urea fertilizer rates (T1-0%; T2-75%; T3-100%; T4-125% of Department of
Agriculture recommendation [DOA] of 315 kg/ha), two urea fertilizer rates amended with
SAP (T5-100%; T6-75% of DOA), T7-75% DOA amended with DCD/NBPT, and T8-
Bio-char compound fertilizer (Bio-Carbon Hybrid [BCH]). The DCD 15%, NBPT 30%
commercially available stabilizer was used with the rate of 2 ml per 1kg of urea in the
T7. The result showed that cumulative Ammonia Nitrogen loss was below 2% of the
applied Nitrogen amount. The highest ammonia emission was observed in T2, T3, and
T5. The T6, T7, and T8 reported more than a 50% reduction in Ammonia emission
compared to T2, T3, T4, and T5. The DOA-recommended Nitrogen fertilizer rate
amended with SAP (T5) gave the highest AEN. There was no significant difference (p
&lt;0.05) in AEN among T2, T4, T6, and T7. The green cob yield did not show a significant
difference (p &lt;0.05) among 100% (T2) 125% DOA recommendation (T3), 100% DOA
recommendation with SAP (T5), 75% of recommended Nitrogen rate amended with
DCD/NBPT (T7) and BCH (T8). Results suggest that the DOA-recommended urea rates
could be reduced by 25% without yield reduction by amending urea with SAP,
DCD/NBPT, and BCH.

Nitrogen (N) is the main element of the tea sector that affects the tea yield. Fertilizer costs
represent 8-12% in the tea sectors and the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of applied
fertilizer in tea is less than 40% and the rest being lost to the environment. Therefore, it
is essential to find ways to improve NUE while enhancing the green leaf production. This
study was initiated to investigate the impact of different fertilizer mixtures on the
productivity and quality of green leaves and the emission of ammonia. A field experiment
was conducted in VP tea fields of TRI 2025 (Camellia sinensis L. (Kuntze)) in
Diyanillakale Estate, Lindula, Nuwara-Eliya. Five fertilizer treatments (T1- No Nitrogen;
T-2 TRI recommended 100% U709 (200kg /ha/3 months); T3-75% of TRI recommended
nitrogen portion; T4-75% of TRI recommended nitrogen portion + CIC Bio-carbon
Hybrid (40kg/acre/3 months); T5-75% of TRI recommended nitrogen portion +
DCD+NBPT) were assessed. Growth and yield production of green leaves and ammonia
emission was measured about three months after applying the fertilizer treatments in
August 2022. Results showed that there was no difference (P>0.05) in Ammonia
emission among treatments and the overall emission was around 2% of the total N
applied. Cumulative green leaf production for the study was higher in TRI 100% (T2)
and TRI 75% of N portion + CIC Bio-carbon Hybrid (T4) treatments. The SPAD meter
readings were higher in TRI 100% treatment. There was no difference (P>0.05) in leaf
Polyphenol content, leaf photosynthetic efficiency and Banji weight among treatments.
Overall results suggest that N requirement could be reduced by 25% with amending the
U709 with CIC Bio-carbon Hybrid.

Biological control is a trending solution for insect pest control around the world. Use of
entomopathogens as a biological control agent is recognized as a promising strategy. In
Sri Lanka, research on entomopathogens is scant. Therefore, this research study was
planned with the objective of identifying and determining the bio-efficacy of
entomopathogenic fungal species associated with cabbage caterpillars. In order to fulfill
this requirement a survey of cabbage ecosystems and a series of laboratory experiments
were conducted. During the survey, Metarhizium sp. was identified in a sample collected
from an ecological farm at Bandarawela as a potential biological control agent for
cabbage caterpillars. The performance of the fungal species was evaluated by conducting
a bioassay using cabbage cluster caterpillar (Crocidolomia pavonana (F.)). A pure culture
of Metarhizium sp. was obtained and the fungal inoculum was prepared from spores
harvested from two week old cultures. As treatments, three different concentrations of
spore suspension; 1×102, 1×104, 1×106 spores/mL, and distilled water was used as a
control. Five healthy second-instar larvae were used, each with four replicates. Direct
spraying method and leaf dip method were used as application methods. In both
application methods, all the spore concentrations gave significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher
mortality than the control. In direct spraying method, the spore concentration of 1×106
spores/mL produced 50% mean mortality, while lower concentrations produced lower
mortality (20%). In the leaf dip method, a similar mortality trend was observed. The spore
concentration of 1×106 spores/mL produced 65% mean mortality, while the lower spore
concentrations produced 20% mortality. Metarhizium sp. significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced
larval growth and the durations of larval instars and pupal stage. The research outcomes
indicate that the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium sp. was pathogenic to cabbage
caterpillars and has the potential to develop as a microbial pesticide.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
A study was conducted to assess the prevalence of major reproductive disorders and to
evaluate the reproductive performance of dairy cattle in the Vavuniya veterinary range.
Out of 924 dairy cows that were investigated, 193 cows (20.89%) had encountered at
least one major reproductive disorder. Repeat breeding (8.66%), abortion (5.41%) and
dystocia (3.57%) were recorded with high prevalence, whereas retained fetal membrane
(1.62%), stillbirth (1.41%), and uterine and vaginal prolapse (0.22%) were recorded with
lower prevalence. The overall incidence of reproductive disorders showed statistical
significance (P&lt;0.05) with respect to the age of the animals and production system. There
was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of reproductive disorders with
respect to the breed of the animals. The prevalence of reproductive disorders in the semi-
intensive system (23.14%) was higher than in the extensive system (11.05%). Moreover,
the prevalence was higher in 5-7 years (34.68%) than in 3-5 years (28.40%), and 7 years
(25.83%) age groups. The overall mean±standard deviation for age at first service,
calving to first service interval, calving to conception interval and calving interval were
27.05±5.58 months (n=90), 52.30±14.86 days (n=240), 109.62±29.70 days (n=240) and
13.02±1.16 months (n=165), respectively. The first service conception rate was 28.75%
(n=240). In conclusion, it can be recommended that the improvement in the management
system, proper selection of bull or timing of AI, accurate heat detection, routine and
periodical reproductive examinations of cows have to be conducted to minimize the
incidence of reproductive disorders and associated risk factors.

Assessment of the Diversity of Selected Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus
Lam.) Accessions in Gannoruwa and Horana Field-Gene Banks

Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) is a tropical, evergreen tree that belongs to the
family Moraceae. Mainly it is grown in Asian, African, and South American regions of
the world. Jackfruit needs minimum inputs and thrives well in marginal environments
making it an ideal crop to cater to the increasing demand for food with the population
expansion, yet it is an underutilized crop in Sri Lanka. Identification of accessions with
elite characters is important to select superior cultivars. Hence, this study was conducted
to explore the diversity of selected jackfruit accessions in Gannoruwa and Horana field
genebanks using morphological and molecular characters and to check the suitability of
jackfruit across Sri Lanka. Morphological diversity was assessed by scoring seven traits.
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of morphological data was conducted in R
programming language. More than 40% variation existed between the first two principal
components. A dendrogram with nine clusters was obtained for the selected 21
accessions. PCR primers for four genes (adh1, AMY1, G3pdh, and PEPC) were designed
using the jackfruit genome sequence available in the Online Resource for Community
Annotation of Eukaryotes (ORCAE) database. One accession from each cluster was then
used for molecular characterization. The Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) were done
to adh1, rbcL, and matK gene regions. But all the PCR failed thus, molecular
characterization was discontinued. The suitability of the environment was tested using
ENMTools implemented in the R program. This study showed the selected jackfruit
accessions possess sufficient morphological diversity, hence, nine clusters were obtained.
All of Sri Lanka seems fairly suitable for the cultivation of jackfruit. For future direction,
it is suggested to carry out an analysis of genetic diversity by optimizing the DNA
extraction protocol and using better molecular markers. The morphological dataset must
be expanded by including more useful characters.

Grain yield of rice in Sri Lanka has increased from 1.5 t ha⁻1 in the 1950s to 4.3 t ha⁻1 in
2010, and this is mainly due to the improved management and genetic makeup of the rice
crop. Despite this increase, the rate of increase in productivity has declined or almost
plateaued in recent years. It is not yet clear whether the improved management over the
years has significantly affected on improving grain yield of rice. In order to test this, data
collected from one rice variety grown continuously over the years in one location is
needed. Therefore, this study was conducted to test the effect of improved management
on improving grain yield of rice in Sri Lanka. Data were collected from the
check/standard varieties (i.e. Bg300, Bg352, Bg358 and At362) used in the National
Coordinated Rice Varietal Trials (NCRVT) available at the Rice Research and
Development Institute (RRDI) at Batalagoda, Sri Lanka. Data on yield, planting date,
harvesting date and weather for crop duration were recorded from 1998 to 2020 for both
Yala and Maha seasons. Results revealed that the productivity has not changed over the
years in most of the locations, seasons, or varieties, with few exceptions, i.e. over the
years, productivity has decreased in Ambalanota and Sammanthurai, increased in
Girandurukotte, Bentota, and Labuduwa, and shown both changes in Bombuwala. The
average seasonal maximum temperature, average seasonal temperature difference, and
total seasonal rainfall were found to have significant positive correlations with crop
productivity. In contrast, the average seasonal minimum temperature had a negative
correlation with crop productivity. Results of this study indicate that the crop
management practices adopted with time have not affected to improve rice crop
productivity. Therefore, it is necessary understand promising crop management practices
to improve crop productivity and break the yield stagnation in rice.

Lead (Pb) is one of the most common contaminants in soils. The most significant transfer
pathway of Pb from soils to humans is via direct soil ingestion, which can be assessed by
in-vitro bioaccessibility tests. Incorporation of organic amendments and liming materials
has shown potential to reduce Pb bioaccessibility in soils. This study evaluated the
effectiveness of incorporating organic amendments and CaCO3 on reducing the
bioaccessibility of Pb in an acidic soil. The field experiment was conducted in Hawa
Eliya (6.968263°N,80.787415°E). The amendments were arranged in randomized
complete block design with 4 blocks. The risk of direct ingestion of soil Pb was assessed
by the standard simplified physiologically based extraction test at pH 2.5. Soils were
passed through 250µm sieve prior to analysis to represent the fine soil fraction that could
adhere to skin and potentially transfer to humans via soil ingestion. Initial total Pb
concentration ranged from 98 to 296mg/kg and the initial pH of the soil was 6.25. The
amendments were diluted soil total Pb concentration by 5 to 20% when compared with
the unamended control. The bioaccessible Pb concentration of the soil was low and
ranged from 1 to 3.5 mg/kg and it was 1.5 to 5% from the total Pb concentration. None
of the amendments significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced the bioaccessible Pb concentration,
but lime-added soils had the lowest bioaccessible Pb, which was 48 to 50 times lower
than the control. A significant negative correlation was observed between bioaccessible
Pb concentration and pH of the remaining soil-gastric after the in-vitro extraction. Lime
reduced the acidity of the gastric solution and consequently it reduced the bioaccessible
Pb. Incorporation of lime had potential to reduce the transfer of soil Pb to humans via
direct soil ingestion.

A study was conducted to assess the effect of nitrification inhibition on potato crop
growth and nitrate leaching from the soil under plant-house conditions. First, cinnamon
leaf powder (CLP), cinnamon oil (CO), Venivelgeta powder (VP) and dicyandiamide
(DCD) were added separately to a soil (Ultisol soil order) collected from a potato grown
field and their impact on potential nitrification rate (PNR) was assessed. Application of
CLP resulted in significantly (P&lt;0.05) low PNR (1.12 µg/ml/day) followed by VP (6.84
µg/ml/day) and CO (10.46 µg/ml/day). Comparable PNR were observed for the DCD-
applied treatment and soil-only control (13.30 and 12.01 µg/ml/day, respectively).
Secondly, a pot experiment was conducted in a plant house in Nuwara-Eliya, where
potato was grown with seven N-treatments; zero urea (T1), urea applied at 100%
recommended rate (T2), T2+DCD (T3), T2+CLP (T4), T2+VP (T5), and T2-25% urea
(T6) T2+25% urea (T7). Leachates was collected from pots after each irrigation event
that allowed free drainage and measured for NO3- concentration. At 70 days after planting
crop was harvested and yield and plant dry-biomass were recorded. Cumulative NO3-
leached was significantly (P&lt;0.05) different between treatments and the lowest was
observed in T1 (29.4±1.25 mg). Cumulative NO3- leached from T3 and T4 were
comparable to T1. The highest values were observed for T2 (45.7±3.47 mg) and T7
(46.9±3.54 mg). Potato yield was significantly affected (P &lt;0.05) by treatments. The
highest yield was recorded in T4 (311±4.1g) and the lowest was in T3 (203±20.7g).
Potato yields for T7 (287±29.1g) and T5 (253±29.1g) were comparable. Results indicated
that the CLP, VP, and CO are effective in suppressing nitrification in the studied potato-
grown soil while DCD did not show strong effective nitrification inhibition. Further, CLP
was effective in improving growth of potato.

An adequate Nitrogen (N) supply is a requirement for maize to achieve its yield potential.
Recent shortages of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer in Sri Lanka have prompted search for
alternative means of nitrogen supply to maize crops. Intercropping with a legume is one
such pathway, as the nitrogen fixed via biological fixation could be made available to
maize. Study was conducted to determine whether intercropping maize with mung bean
could compensate for a reduced supply of inorganic nitrogen. The field experiment was
done at the Dodangolla Experimental Station during Maha 2022-23 in a randomized
complete block design in three blocks. Maize was cultivated as the main crop in sole and
mixed stands with mung bean, at 100% and 50% of recommended external nitrogen
levels. At 50% flowering of maize (two months after planting) soil available nitrogen
(NO3- fraction) and leaf nitrogen concentrations were significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater in
intercropped plots at 50% nitrogen levels, compared to sole maize with 50%N. Total
nitrogen uptake of intercrops at both N levels was not significantly different from their
respective sole crops at 50% flowering of both crops and it was significantly lower at
50%N in both stands. Intercrop maize yield was not significantly (p>0.05) different from
its respective sole crop yield at both N levels. Reduction of N supply reduced maize yield
in both crop stands. Similar patterns were observed for total plant biomass of maize at
one and two months after planting. The intercrops had land equivalent ratios of 1.19
(100%N) and 1.21 (50%N) which demonstrated an increased land productivity at both N
levels. This additive population mixtures of intercropping increases land productivity,
even at sub-optimal external nitrogen supply. Continuous intercropping of maize with
mung bean over several seasons may ultimately compensate for the yield loss due to
reduced nitrogen supply.

Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are a potential feed ingredient, because of their high
protein and fat contents. Considering the critical impact of substrate moisture content
(MC) on BSFL production, the effect of substrate MC on performance and nutritional
quality of BSFL reared on various substrates was evaluated. This study was composed of
two experiments (Exp.1 &amp; Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, BSFL were reared on five substrates; layer
chicken feed (control), cattle manure, poultry manure (PM), swine manure, and vegetable
waste (VW), and four MCs; 45%, 65%, 75%, and 85%. Based on the bioconversion
performance of Exp. 1., two optimum substrates; VW and PM, and two optimum MCs;
75% and 85% were selected for Exp. 2. Subsequently, five substrate compositions
(0%VW+100%PM, 25%VW+75%PM, 50%VW+50%PM, and 75%VW+25%PM,
100%VW+0%PM) were prepared. Two MCs (75%, and 85%) were maintained to
evaluate varying MC on different substrate compositions for rearing BSFL. Both
experiments were conducted as two-factor factorial, completely randomized designs
(Three replicates/treatment and 80 BSFL/replicate). Based on the results of Exp. 2, the
bioconversion of substrates by BSFL and total pre-pupal weight per replicate were higher
(P&lt;0.05) in 85% MC than 75% MC for all substrate combinations except
0%VW+100%PM. Despite the lower amount of provided total nitrogen through the
substrate, a higher (P&lt;0.05) nitrogen conversion ratio was reported for
100%VW+0%PM. Based on the results, the optimum substrate composition and MC for
BSFL production were 100%VW+0%PM and 85%, respectively. Hence, this operation
would be most profitable to be practiced in a vegetable-livestock integrated farming
system allowing the utilization of VW to produce a valuable protein source for feeding
animals.

Yard Long Bean (Vigna unguiculata ssp. sesquipedalis) belonging to family Fabaceae is
a very popular leguminous vegetable crop grown and consumed in Sri Lanka. Plant
Genetic Resources Centre (PGRC) at Gannoruwa, Peradeniya has conserved 728
accessions of yard long bean (YLB) in Sri Lanka. This experiment was conducted at the
open field of PGRC, Gannoruwa, Peradeniya to characterize 42 uncharacterized
accessions and one recommended variety; Gannoruwa A9 was used as the check variety
with reference to characterization catalogue of YLB (PGRC, 1999). The characterization
catalogue has a 29 qualitative and quantitative morphological character list. According
to the results, only 19% were dwarf and 81% showed twining growth habit with four
types of twining variations. Accession 19 had the minimum number of days for floral
initiation and accession 1605 showed the minimum days for harvesting of green pods.
Accessions 1094, 1141, 2352, 289, 1165 and 1298 had red to violet colour pods and 29%
of the accessions had variegated pods. Gannoruwa A9 showed maximum values when
considering pod length, pod width and pod weight. There were only three types of seed
shapes as Kidney (74%), ovoid (17%) and Rhomboid (9%). The accession 1094 had the
maximum value for hundred seed weight. The dendrogram obtained using morphological
characters separated four major clusters at the distance of 1.5. The first cluster contained
only 3 accessions 1356, 344, 1150. The second cluster contained 7 accessions. The third
cluster was the largest with 30 accessions. And the fourth cluster was the smallest with
only 2 accessions; Gannoruwa A9 and accession 689. According to the results obtained
for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) at least 10 PCs were required to explain 78.9%-
character variation among accessions. These results are very much important for systemic
germplasm conservation and utilization of prominent traits for crop varietal improvement
programs.

Potato is a main tuber crop grown in soils with high phosphorous (P) reserves in the up
country of Sri Lanka. A field experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of
seed inoculants of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and Phosphate Solubilizing
Bacteria (PSB) in mobilizing of P reserves from soils in a randomized complete block
design with seven treatments; no fertilizer (T1), recommended NPK fertilizers (T2),
recommended N+K+½P (T3), T3+PSB (T4), T4+AMF strain 1 (T5), T4+AMF strain 2
(T6), T4+AMF strain 3 (T7) with three replicates. Plants were uprooted in 6 weeks after
planting (WAP) and 9 WAP. Shoot, root and tuber weights were recorded at both
sampling whereas tissue N, P and Zn concentrations and root infection of AMF were
assessed at 6 WAP. Tissue P content was significantly higher in T5 (1517 g/kg) than in
T2 (1190 mg/kg). Treatment with only PSB showed a significantly higher Zn
accumulation in tissues (47.8 mg/kg) than in all other treatments (6.5-36.0 mg/Kg).
Inoculation of AMF resulted in significantly higher root infections of hyphae (74 -79%)
and arbuscules (24 - 37%) than non-inoculated treatments (15-56 % and 2-14%,
respectively). Significantly higher shoot dry weights were reported in T5 (52.7g) than in
T2 (33.4g) at 9 WAP. Tuber weights per plant was significantly higher in T5 (162 g) than
in other (99-146 g) at 6 WAP but on par with T2 (T2=421 g; T5=423 g) at 9 WAP.
Correlation analysis indicated that tuber weights depend on tissue P (r=0.60, P&lt;0.05),
tissue Zn (r=0.66, P&lt;0.01), hyphae infection (r=0.67, P&lt;0.01) and shoot (r=0.67, P&lt;0.01)
and root (r=0.63, P&lt;0.01) weights. Results suggest that co-inoculation of AMF strain 1
and PSB could effectively enhance P and Zn uptake and thereby growth and yield of
potato irrespective of 50% cut down of TSP.

Properties

Oil palm and rubber are major plantation crops in Sri Lanka. Oil palm has been cultivated
in the Low-Country Wet-Zone region of Sri Lanka. However, in 2021 government
banned the cultivation of oil palm due to the complains made by the public indicating
that oil palm cultivation depletes soil properties, biological diversity, and water table
without any scientific evidence. Thus, this experiment was conducted to investigate the
impact of 10-12 years old oil palm and rubber-cultivated lands in Nakiyadeniya and
Sapumalkanda estates on soil properties. Soil physical properties of two soil depths (0-
15 and 15-30 cm) from 3m (inter-raw spacing) and 1m distance from the tree bases of
representative oil palm and rubber trees were assessed. Soil samples taken from 1m away
from the tree-base showed that the dry-aggregate stability was higher in oil palm
compared to rubber lands (P&lt;0.05). However, the wet aggregate stability, hydraulic
conductivity, gravimetric water content at saturated level, gravimetric water content in
field capacity, volumetric water content in saturated and volumetric water content in field
capacity, organic carbon content, and bulk density were not significantly different
(P>0.05) between tree types. Soil properties of inter-rows indicated that, dry aggregate
stability, gravimetric water content at saturated level, and volumetric water content at
saturated level were greater in Oil palm (P&lt;0.05), but the wet aggregate stability,
hydraulic conductivity, gravimetric water content at field capacity, volumetric water
content in field capacity, organic carbon content, and bulk density were not significantly
different (P>0.05) between tree types. Overall, it could be concluded that, except the
lower dry aggregate stability in rubber, all other soil physical properties were similar in
oil palm and rubber-cultivated lands of the age category of 10-12 years old, where
optimum canopy coverage could be observed.

Different tea estates practice different harvesting intervals ranging from seven to ten
days. Harvesting operation have a high impact on the productivity of a tea land, the cost
of production and the quality of harvested leaf. The objective of the present study was to
compare three to four rounds of harvesting of tea per month. Two factor factorial was
used as the experimental design. Those two factors were plucking frequency (7 and 10
days) and cultivars of tea (DYN, DT1, N2, and Old Seedling Tea). A schedule was made
and data of leaf yield, leaf standard, and severity of plucking and total cost was calculated.
Results showed that monthly leaf yield is higher under 10 day plucking interval than 7
days plucking interval in both October and November months. However, the gap tends
to get narrower in November month. This can be attributed heavy rain occurred in
November month and the fact that the estate has been practicing 9 day plucking interval.
When consider leaf standard as fine plucking, it was significantly higher in October
month with 7 day interval when compared to 10 day interval. But the differences were
non-significant in November. However, when we consider fine and medium plucking
together (i.e., good leaf standard) mean differences in leaf standard was non-significant
even in October. This could be attributed to heavy rains occurred during November where
the yields were dropped significantly. The drop was high as 60% with some cultivars.
When consider the monthly cost, 10 day harvesting cost was significantly higher than 7
day harvesting cost among all cultivars except OST during October. This study shows
some insights about the impact of changing plucking intervals on the green leaf yield and
cost of harvesting. A long-term study is required to understand the yield differences under
different harvesting intervals.

The influence of three levels of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) inclusion (0, 15 and 30%
of soybean meal [SBM]) was tested for Cobb-500 broilers and naked-neck (NN)
indigenous chickens in a 2×3 factorial arrangement. Isoenergetic and isonitrogenous
experimental diets were formulated to meet the nutrient requirements by Cobb-500 for
the grower (14-21d) and finisher phases (22-35d). A total of 7d-old 180 birds (90 broilers
and 90 NN) were randomly distributed into 30 cages (five replicates/treatment, six
birds/replicate). Birds were acclimatized for live feeding of BSFL from 7 to 14d and fed
experimental diets from 14 to 35d. Based on growth performance (14 -35d), the responses
of body weight gain (BWG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) to bird type interacted with
BSFL inclusion level (P&lt;0.05). Both BWG and FCR of Cobb-500 were higher in 0% and
15% BSFL compared to 30% BSFL in the diet. However, BWG of NN was not
influenced by the increasing dietary inclusion of BSFL. Compared to the control diet
(100% SBM), BSFL inclusion at 15 and 30% of SBM increased the FCR of NN.
Comparing only Cobb-500 broilers, the apparent ileal crude protein digestibility was
higher (P&lt;0.05) in 30% BSFL than in the control diet. Irrespective of the bird type, 15%
and 30% BSFL reduced the gizzard pH (P&lt;0.01) compared to the control. Considering
meat quality, water holding capacity was not influenced by tested parameters (P>0.05).
Cooking loss was influenced by both bird type and BSFL inclusion level (P&lt;0.05). The
relative weights of heart, liver and gizzard were higher (P&lt;0.05) in NN compared to
broilers. Based on growth performance, BSFL could replace up to 15 and 30% of SBM
for broilers and NN, respectively, without comprising the BWG.

The present study was carried out under greenhouse conditions at Jiffy Pvt. Ltd.,
Kobeigane, Sri Lanka (IL3). Plant growth performance of three vegetable species
(Solanum melongena L., Solanum lycopersicum L., and Capsicum annuum L.) in three
different substrates, comprised of processed waste coir fiber (2 mm) + standard coir fiber
pith (20%:80%) (T1), processed waste coir fiber (2 mm) + standard coir fiber pith
(40%:80%) (T2), and standard coir fiber pith medium (T3-control) were investigated.
The plant growth and substrate parameters were measured. Results showed that particle
composition in the substrate treatments affected the morphological traits and the plant
growth rate. The germination percentages of each of the three crop species grown in the
three treatment mixtures were not significantly different (p>0.05). During the majority
of the weeks, all three crop species grown in T1 and T3 growing media showed
significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) plant growth with respect to shoot length, fresh weight,
plant dry matter, and also without showing any deficiency symptom. The mixture, T2
showed lower plant growth while resulting in leaf yellowing. The overall results indicated
that the growth performance of T1 and T3 growth media was not significantly different
(p>0.05), and the performance of T2 was significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower than T1 and T3
media. Hence, growth media T1 could be selected as a cost-effective alternative growth
media to replace the standard coco peat medium used for raising hydroponic vegetable
crops at a reduced cost of cultivation.

Tea yield and made tea quality may be different in organic and conventional systems due
to different inputs and quantities. This study was conducted in the Uva region of Sri
Lanka on organically and conventionally managed smallholder and medium/ large tea
estates during September to December 2022. Monthly yield records from 2016 to 2022
(except December 2022) were collected from the selected tea lands. The percentage of
shoots containing a banji apical bud with a single adjoining leaf and shoots containing an
active apical bud with two or three adjoining leaves were considered as the plucking
standard. Sensory evaluation was conducted by five independent, professional tea tasters
and samples were rated based on infused leaves, colour, strength, quality, and flavor of
the liquor. Total nitrogen content of the made tea was determined using Kjeldahl method.
Data were considered as a nested factorial (cultivation system and land category).
Parametric data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA and sensory evaluation
data were analyzed using Friedman's test. Results showed that the conventional
smallholder fields had consistently, significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) yields, followed by
organic smallholders. Further, the yields of medium/ large scale plantations in both
cultivation systems were not significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) from each other, but lower
than the smallholders of both systems. Large/ medium scale and smallholder organic
farmers maintained a significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) plucking standard compared to all
conventional farmers. The total nitrogen contents of the made tea from conventional
system were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than in organic system. The ratings of the tea
taster’s evaluations were inconsistent between the cultivation systems, but dust-1 grade
of conventional and BOP of organic lands had consistently higher ratings from the tea
tasters.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the staple food for Sri Lankans as well as for more than two-
fifths of the world's population. Rice is grown in all the districts in Sri Lanka with varying
productivity and cultivation extents. Even though, rice crop productivity and the
cultivation extent over the years have changed, the degree of change in the recent past
has not been studied. Therefore, this study was conducted with the objectives of (i)
examining the trends of rice crop productivity and harvested extent over the years in
different districts of Sri Lanka, and (ii) estimating the irrigation water-use efficiency of
rice cropping systems in Mahaweli areas in Sri Lanka. Crop productivity and harvested
extend data from different districts, seasons, and water management schemes in Sri Lanka
during the period from 1979-2021 were used. Irrigation water-use efficiency of rice was
calculated for Mahaweli systems B, C, H, and Udawalawa for Yala and Maha seasons
for the period from 2014-2020. Results revealed that, rice crop productivity has increased
significantly with time. Productivity increment ranged from 10.2-50.5, 13.6-56.2, 11.1-
54.9 kg ha˗1 year˗1 for Maha season, and ˗104.3-65.2, 22.1-57.4, 10.5-63.1 kg ha˗1 year˗1
for Yala season, respectively for major, minor and rainfed water management systems.
Harvested extend increased in the range of (˗10.7)-798.6, (˗113.1)-606.3, (˗285.1)-369.3
ha year˗1 for Maha season and (˗7.7)-818.5, (˗88.7)-367.2, (˗359.4)-19.8 ha year˗1 for Yala
season, respectively for major, minor and rainfed water management systems. Irrigation
water-use efficiency in Maha season resulted higher value (0.45 kg m˗ 3) than that in Yala
season (0.32 kg m˗ 3). Mahaweli system ‘H’ had the highest (0.38 kg m˗ 3) irrigation water-
use efficiency during Yala season. This information would be useful when making
administrative decisions when improving rice farming and Agriculture sector in Sri
Lanka.

In ornamental aquaculture, best stocking densities of a species for aquarium keeping is
needed in order to maintain a better survival of aquarium fish. Pearlspot (Etroplus
suratensis) is a popular food fish. Its’ vibrant colors and similar shape to “discus” fish
make them a formidable candidate for aquarium keeping, though no studies were done in
this regard. The aim of this study was to estimate optimal stocking density for pearlspot
in captive conditions. The effects of 3 stocking densities were evaluated on growth and
survival during 50-day experimental period in captivity. The experiment had 3 stocking
densities as: Low Stocking Density (LSD- 0.13 fish/L), Medium Stocking Density
(MSD-0.16 fish/L) and High stocking density (HSD-0.2 fish/L) in triplicates. Adult fish
(total length range from 8.11±0.35 cm to 11.8±0.67 cm) were stocked in experimental
tanks (Length*Breadth*Height: 86*70*25 cm) and fed with a commercial diet containing
40% crude protein. Survival Rate (SR) and growth parameters such as body weight gain
(BWG), body length gain (BLG), average daily weight gain (ADWG), average daily
length gain (ADLG) and specific growth rate (SGR) were calculated during the
experiment period. The experimental design was Complete Randomized Design. The
result of BWG, ADWG and SGR were significantly different (P&lt; 0.05) among
treatments. The BLG and ADLG were not significantly different (P&lt;0.05) among
treatments. The Highest BWG was reported by fish raised at HSD (2.27±0.45 g) than
MSD (1.64±0.64 g) and LSD (1.20±0.899 g). There were no mortalities found in any
experimental tanks, hence, the survival rate for all the treatments was 100%. The result
from this study revealed that the stocking density of 0.2 fish/L can be used as the optimum
stocking density for rearing pearlspot in tanks under captivity and this can be further
studied to introduce pearlspot as an aquarium fish.

Floriculture sector is the one of the popular sectors all over the world. Cut flowers,
bedding plants, potted plants, cut foliage dried flowers are major product in floriculture
sector. Sri Lankan cut flower industry has a limited type of flowers. Orchid flowers have
high demand in the Sri Lankan floriculture sector. Among orchids dendrobium is one of
the potential cut flowers in flower industry. It is belonging to family Orchidaceae which
is mainly use for decorative purposes. There are number of colors and hybrids. However,
unavailability of quality planting material is the major constraint for its use among the
local growers. Success of in vitro propagation experiment based on plant material which
can tolerate adverse condition. Therefore, efforts were mainly focused on the production
of in vitro plants, which show higher survival rate in the field condition. This study was
undertaken to find out the best acclimatization medium for tissue cultured dendrobium
orchid plants. The effect of different acclimatization media including, charcoal (T1),
charcoal: brick (1:1) (T2), Charcoal: brick: coconut chips (1:1:1) (T3), and metal chips:
coir dust (1:1) (T4) on tissue cultured dendrobium orchid plants were investigated. Plants
were placed inside the propagator. Two weeks after planting acclimatization was done
by gradually opening the polythene covers. Then two months after planting plants were
remove from the propagator and placed inside the plant house. The highest survival rate
(65%) as well as most of the growth parameters was observed in the charcoal: brick (T2).
Therefore, charcoal: bricks (1:1) (T2) can be recommended as the best medium for the
survival of the plants after acclimatization.

Do Tea Plants Physiologically Benefit from The Shade Cast by Shade
Trees? A Case Study from the Mid-Country Wet Zone in Sri Lanka

Shade trees in tea lands are expected to provide required shade levels to tea plants. Shade
cast by shade trees supports several physiological processes that help tea maintaining its
health, yield, and quality of the finished product. The effect of shade on changes in
physiological processes in various plants is well documented. Therefore, in the present
study, we hypothesized that shade alters the physiological process of tea plants. To test
the hypothesis, two tea fields from an estate in the mid-country wet zone with high- and
medium-shade trees were selected for the study. On bright sunny days, the shade-cast
area was measured and modeled in the East-West direction in the morning, noon, and
evening. Four points in the shade-cast area and two points from the un-shaded area were
selected, and the light intensity and the spectrum in the range of 320-850 nm were
measured using a spectroradiometer. At each point, the chlorophyll content (Ch. A, Ch.
B., and Total chlorophyll) was also measured spectrophotometrically and soil nutrients
were measured. The shade-casted area was significantly different (P&lt;0.05) depending on
the shade tree and the time of the day. The soil nutrients in all fields measured were also
different (P&lt;0.05), especially higher in medium-shade trees. The light spectrum at each
point measured was also different (P&lt;0.05), especially with high-shade trees. Although
there were differences in shade-casted area and light spectrum (red: blue and red: far-red
ratios), there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the leaf chlorophyll content and
yield in all the points measured under the selected shade-casted area, compared to that of
the leaves in un-shaded areas. These findings alarm us to revisit the real purpose of having
shade trees in tea fields. However, further studies along an altitudinal gradient are also
suggested.

Jasminum sambac is grown worldwide for the extraction of jasmine essential oil from
flower buds. This study was conducted to increase the flower bud production. Effect of
tip pruning (T1), pruning 15 cm above the ground (hard pruning) (T2), pruning 15 cm
above the ground (hard pruning) followed by tip pruning (T3), and pruning the excess
lengthy branches followed by 230 ppm paclobutrazol application (T4) or without
paclobutrazol application (T5) on flowering and branching of J. sambac was investigated
using 2.5 years old plants. As jasmine flowers are produced at the terminals of the shoots,
by increasing the number of secondary shoots, flower bud yield can be increased. There
is a significant difference of cumulative number of secondary shoots per primary shoot
in hard pruning (T2), (P&lt;0.05) and it changed at an increasing rate over the time. Pruning
of the excess lengthy branches followed by the application of 230 ppm paclobutrazol
(T4), showed the best results with regards to the cumulative number and cumulative
weight of flower buds (P&lt;0.05). However, the application of paclobutrazol (T4), reduced
the diameter of the flower buds. Changes in the yield parameters were observed within
1-3 weeks of paclobutrazol application. Overall, 6-9 weeks after tip pruning (T1), hard
pruning (T2) and hard pruning followed by tip pruning (T3), produced better yields. Hard
pruning (T2) is effective for increasing the number of secondary shoots, while pruning
of the lengthy branches followed by paclobutrazol application (T4) increases the flower
yield. Pruning of the excessively lengthy branches (T5) was not an effective practice. The
combination of hard pruning and paclobutrazol is best for increasing yield.

Myzus persicae

Department of Agricultural Biology,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) causes significant losses in many crops, and one of the
key vectors of CMV is Myzus persicae Sulzer (Aphididae). CMV 2b protein is a counter-
defence factor and symptom determinant. Effect of the 2b protein on aphids was well
investigated using 2b deleted mutant viruses. However, the detailed description of the
dynamic change in aphid performance in 2b expressing transgenic plants has not been
reported. We investigated the effect of 2b protein on aphid vectors using 2b transgenic
Nicotiana benthamiana. The estimated survival percentages of aphids 30 days after the
introduction to 2b transgenic and wild-type plants were 60% and 22.5%, respectively.
Even though early reproductive maturity of aphids was reported on wild-type plants, the
total population over a 30-day period was significantly (P=0.00) higher in aphids on 2b
transgenic plants compared to that of wild-type plants. The mean fecundity over a 30-day
observation period was 24.5 and 10.4 for aphids grown on 2b transgenic and wild-type
plants, respectively. However, there was no significant difference (P=0.117) in the
intrinsic rate of increase (mr) of the aphids grown on 2b transgenic plants and wild-type
plants. The longevity of aphids was significantly higher on 2b transgenic plants compared
to that of wild-type plants (P=0.012). Similarly, 2b transgenic plants are significantly
more susceptible to M. persicae in terms of time for 1st probing (P=0.004) and duration
of phloem sap-feeding (P=0.011). According to our results, we conjecture that the CMV
2b protein plays a significant role in modification of life history traits of M. persicae.

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of in-house temperature
regulation via humidifiers and fans on the daily milk production in temperate dairy cattle
breeds managed in Ridiyagama National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) farm.
Daily milk yield records of 3154 Jersey and Jersey x Friesian crossbreds in their first
lactation were collected. Daily in-house milking parlor minimum and maximum
temperature and relative humidity were collected for the same period from 2016 to 2017
to derive the Temperature Humidity Index (THI). The data cleaning and analysis were
performed using the R programming language. The mean THI was 80.21 and 78.22
during 2016 and 2017, respectively, and daily THI ranged from 71.81 to 85.88. A linear
mixed effects model was fitted with THI, breed, days in milk, season, and milking
duration as fixed effects, and animal as the random effect. All fixed effects including the
THI were significant (P&lt;0.05). The Jersey-Friesian crossbreds produced 1.2 L more than
the Jersey cows. The daily milk yield was decreased by 0.03 L with one unit increase in
THI. Even though the daily This were within the accepted range for temperate dairy cattle
breeds according to the literature, the association between THI and daily milk yield
suggests that cows were prone to heat stress. In conclusion, the THI within the milking
parlour is a significant determinant of cows’ daily milk production, and Jersey-Friesian
crossbreds outperformed Jersey cows under heat stress. Improving the THI prior to
milking might reduce the heat burden and loss of milk yield thereof.

Effect of Different Color Shade Nets on Growth and Development of
Acclimatized Tissue Cultured Anthurium Plants

Department of Crop Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Floriculture is divided into four groups depending on the production. The usage of
floriculture products varies with the countries. Anthurium is a popular genus that belongs
to the family Araceae. Anthurium plants used as a cut flower as well as an ornamental
pot plant and require shady, humid conditions for the growth. In tropical climate,
anthurium plants are unable to grow under natural light conditions without shade. Shade
nets are widely used to protect crops from wind, rain, hail and excessive radiation. The
photo selective netting concept was studied in anthurium plants using three different
coloured shade nets. Black, red and aluminet shade nets and expose to full sunlight
(control) were used as the treatments. Plant growth parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence
data, and light parameters were measured. Light intensity, photosynthetically active
radiation, spectrum irradiance was measured under each shade net. Highest spectrum
irradiance was measured outside and then followed by black shade net, aluminet and red
net. As plant growth parameters, plant height, number of newly emerged leaves, shoot
and root dry weight and chlorophyll content were measured. Major parameters derived
from OJIP analysis, including Performance Index (PI), Photochemical efficiency
(FV/FM), Effective antenna size (ABS/RC), Electron transport per reaction centre
(ET0/RC), Electron transport efficiency (ET/TR), Heat dissipation per reaction Centre
(DI0/RC), Trapping per reaction centre (TR0/RC) were recorded. Plant survival rate was
measured at each shade nets and control environment. Highest plant survival rate was
observed in black shade net. Lowest plant survival rate was observed in aluminet shade
net. Therefore, black color shade net can be recommended for a better growth and
development of anthurium plants.

Continuous application of organic and inorganic fertilizers can cause environmental risk
associated with the pollution of soils with potentially toxic elements (PTEs). Therefore,
this study was conducted to assess the effect of different fertilizer practices on availability
of PTEs in coconut growing soils in Sri Lanka. A pot experiment and a field survey were
conducted. The pot experiment was performed with sandy regosols (20 kg of soil/pot).
The treatments were 1) No fertilizer (Control), 2) inorganic fertilizer (IF), 3) cattle
manure (CM), 4) goat manure (GM) and 5) poultry manure (PM). Three replicates were
used in a completely randomized design. Fertilizers and manures were applied based on
the recommendation rates. Pots were maintained at 60% water holding capacity. Soil
samples were collected at 2 and 16 weeks after treatment application (WAT). In the field
survey, soil samples (at 0-25 cm depth; n=…) were collected from the manure circle of
the coconut plantations with different types of organic amendment application history.
Soil samples from both studies were analyzed total and EDTA extractable PTEs
concentrations (i.e., As, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb and Ni). The PM applied soils had
significantly higher EDTA extractable Zn (11±0.07 mg/Kg), Cd (0.02±0.00 mg/Kg) and
Cu (1.7±0.02 mg/Kg) concentrations compared to other treatments at 16 WAT. Cattle
manure has caused high Pb (i.e., 0.36±0.02 mg/Kg) and Ni (i.e., 0.11±0.06 mg/Kg)
concentrations at 16 WAT. EDTA extractable Pb concentration (mg/Kg) in PM
application has a significant reduction from 2WAT (i.e., 0.37±0.03mg/Kg) to 16WAT
(i.e.,0.32±0.01mg/Kg). All the PTEs concentrations were below the maximum
permissible levels for agricultural soils imposed by the European Union implying that
there is no ecological risk of short-term application of organic or inorganic fertilizers for
coconut.

Mulato II (Brachiaria hybrid) is a herbage known for its higher digestibility and
nutritional quality, and thus, recently introduced to Sri Lanka. This study aimed to
determine the effect of different rain shading methods on seed germination, seedling
survival, and the growth performance of Mulato II hybrid growing in the up-country wet
zone, in Sri Lanka. The experiment was conducted with three treatments for shading: fern
(T2), shade net (T3) polythene (T4), and control with no shading (T1) with three replicates
in three blocks. A hundred seeds were planted in each replicate. Seed germination and
seedling survival were measured two weeks and four weeks after planting, respectively.
Plant height, leaf length, number of leaves, and number of tillers were measured four and
six weeks after planting in randomly selected plants (n=12) from each replicate. Soil pH,
soil moisture, available N, P, K, and electrical conductivity were measured. Seed
germination under laboratory conditions in Peradeniya and Watawala was 84% and 80%,
respectively. Collected data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA in Minitab 21.
Results indicated that different rain shading methods significantly (p&lt;0.05) affected the
seed germination, seedling survival, and growth performance of plants. The highest seed
germination (68±5%) and seedlings survival (64 ± 6%) were found in polythene shaded
beds but similar to shade net shaded beds. A significant difference was observed between
all treatments for plant height and leaf length. The highest average values for plant height
and leaf length were 14.3 ± 0.6 cm and 10.1 ± 0.6 cm respectively after one month and
18.9 ± 0.2 cm and 13.5 ± 0.3 cm respectively after 1.5 months in polythene shaded beds.
There was no significant difference between the number of leaves and tillers in all
treatments. Results indicate that polythene shading is effective to improve seed
germination and seedling survival Mulato II.

This study was conducted with the aim of developing Impatiens niamniamensis (Parrot
impatiens) as a dwarf attractive pot plant with more flowers. Stem cuttings consisting of
three nodes were planted and kept for two weeks under a polythene propagator. They
were gradually exposed to sunlight and then transferred to different shade levels (0%,
50%, 70%, and 80%). Each group of plants were subdivided into two parts, and one part
was treated with 25 mL of 5 mg/L paclobutrazol in the sixth week. Plants that were
exposed to 0% shade died within one week after planting. This treatment was not
considered for further analysis. According to the results, the interaction effect of different
shade levels and the application of paclobutrazol significantly affected on plant height
(P&lt;0.0001). But, it was not significant for internodal length (P>0.05). Chlorophyll
fluorescence was lower in 70% shade level with the application of paclobutrazol.
Furthermore, there was no significant difference in maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) (P
>0.05), absorption in active reaction center (ABS/RC) (P>0.05), and trapped energy flux
(ET0/RC) (P>0.05) due to different shade levels and application of paclobutrazol. The
number of flower buds were high in paclobutrazol-treated plants than that kept under
70% shade. There was a significant interaction effect of different shade levels and the
application of paclobutrazol on the number of flower buds (P &lt;0.0001). Color intensity
of the flowers were different (P &lt;0.05) while the length in not significantly different
(P>0.05). There was a significant effect on the number of days taken to flowering among
treatments (P &lt; 0.0001). The 70% shade level and application of paclobutrazol can be
recommended as the best treatment combination for both growth and flowering of I.

Department of Animal Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
At present broiler chicken industry in Sri Lanka is moving towards more intensive closed-
house systems. This study aimed to assess the effect of providing environmental
enrichments(elevated platforms, hanging compact discs, straw bales, and paddy husk area
for dust bathing) on behaviour, fear level, welfare(footpad dermatitis, hock burn,
plumage cleanliness ,and litter quality)and body weight of broiler chickens. On the 10th
day of age, 240 Indian River commercial broiler chicks were randomly distributed into
four pens (n=60). Two replicates per control (no enrichment) and treatment groups were
allocated and the study was carried out in two batches. Data were collected during a four-
week period. Behaviour was assessed by scan sampling method using live observations.
The tonic immobility and novel object tests were performed to measure the fear level of
broiler chickens. Welfare parameters were assessed using a scoring system. The
generalized linear mixed model, Kruskal-Wallis and one-way analysis of variance tests
were used to analyze treatment effects. The frequency of preening behaviour was
significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in treatment groups than control groups in the daytime and
the resting behaviour was lower(P&lt;0.05) in treatment groups than control groups in day
and night in all weeks. The fear level was higher (P&lt;0.05) in control groups than in
treatment groups. The footpad score, hock burns (except the first week), plumage
cleanliness (during the last two weeks) and litter quality (except the first week) was better
(P&lt;0.05) in the treatment groups compared with control groups. Growth rate of birds was
also improved in treatment groups. Overall, the results indicated that providing
environmental enrichments enhanced behaviour, welfare and growth performance of
broiler chickens under closed-house systems.

Effect of Increased Growth Temperature and Soil Moisture Stress on
Chlorophyll Fluorescence in Two Pioneer Tree Seedlings Used in Land
Restoration

Chlorophyll measurements are frequently used in plant stress physiological
investigations because they allow for the measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence from
intact plants and improve understanding of potential alterations in leaf fluorescence
features related to physiological condition. Pioneer tree species, which frequently
encounter stress from the atmosphere's temperature and soil moisture, such in-depth
knowledge is constrained. The most common early successional plant species are
Macaranga peltata (Kanda) and Neolitsea cassia (Dawul kurundu), especially in the low
country and mid country wet zone. Two pioneer plant species, Kanda and Dawul
Kurundu, were grown at two thermal environments (26.0±0.2 oC and 29±0.5 oC) under
field capacity (FC) and soil moisture stress condition (WS, i.e. 50% of the available
water), and chlorophyll fluorescence in fully expanded recently mature leaves was
measured at 28°C and 32°C, respectively, to examine how the above stress conditions
alter the specific components of the higher proficiency. The results showed that at 32 oC
leaf temperature as compared to 28 oC under water stressed conditions, water splitting
activity was affected in both Kanda and Dawul kurundu plants. Furthermore, regardless
of the water treatment, the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry
significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced in both plants when leaf temperature increases from 28 oC
to 32 oC. However, both plants showed a significant (P&lt;0.05) decline in Performance
Index at 32 oC leaf temperature compared to 28 oC under FC and WS conditions. Kanda
and Dawul kurundu plants are particularly vulnerable to the combined effects of soil
moisture and temperature stress when grown together. Chlorophyll fluorescence offers a
thorough grasp of the fundamental phases of photosynthesis.

Chirita Royal is a hybrid perennial flowering plant produced by Royal Botanic Garden,
Peradeniya by crossing Chirita mooni and Chirita zeylanica. The present study was
conducted with the objective of introducing it as a potted flowering plant to the
floriculture industry in Sri Lanka. Effects of Paclobutrazol (5 mg/L), GA3 (50 mg/L),
combination of PBZ (5 mg/L) and GA3 (50 mg/L) and without growth regulators were
investigated on growth and flowering of pinched and non-pinched plants. Each treatment
was replicated 3 times and each replicate consisted of 10 plants. The experiment was
arranged as a Complete Randomized Design (CRD). Plant height, number of days taken
to branching, number of days taken to first flowering, number of branches, number of
flower buds, corolla length, corolla width and spikelet length were measured at 11th week
after planting. Plant height was reduced significantly (P&lt;0.0001) in pinched plants.
Combination of pinching and paclobutrazol reduced the plant height and produced a bush
type Chirita Royal Queen plant. There were significant differences between pinching and
non-pinching for number of days taken to first flowering and number of days taken to
branching. Pinching significantly increased number of lateral branches (P&lt;0.005).
Number of flower buds also significantly increased by pinching (P&lt;0.0001).
Combination of pinching and paclobutrazol produced highest number of flower buds.
GA3 did not affect the flowering of Chirita Royal Queen. As per the results of the study,
combination of pinching and paclobutrazol 5 mg/L can be recommended for producing
an attractive Chirita Royal Queen Plant.

Growth and yield response of rice plants (Oryza sativa) to phosphorus (P) application is
very low in P deficient Alfisols of Sri Lanka. Applied P could become unavailable by
interacting with Zinc (Zn) in soil could be one reason. A net house experiment was
conducted to study the effect of combined application of P and Zn fertilizers on their
availability in soil and response of rice plant in a flooded Alfisol. Soil (Typic Rodaqualf)
was collected from a lowland rice growing field in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. An
availability study was conducted by applying combinations of P (0, 11, 22 and 33 mg/kg)
and Zn (0, 1.1 and 2.2 mg/kg) to soil and measuring the Mehlich-3 extractable P and Zn
contents. Same rates of P and Zn were applied to 5 kg of soil filled pots as triple super
phosphate and zinc sulfate and planted with four germinated rice seeds. Growth
parameters and P and Zn uptake were measured in 8 weeks. Zinc availability increased
in soil but P availability decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) as rate of Zn application
increases. Application of P reduced Zn availability in soil without increasing the P
availability. However, none of these rates were able to increase the available P and Zn
contents in the soil up to optimum rates. Plant height, number of productive tillers per
plant and shoot dry matter content were not significantly (P>0.05) affected by P and Zn
interaction. Application of P significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased in shoot P concentration
while application of Zn at 2.2 mg/kg significantly reduced shoot P concentration.
However, these changes did not affect shoot P and Zn uptake significantly at rates used
in this experiment. Further studies are required to study the effects of higher rates of P
and Zn on their availability and plant responses.

The peelability (detachability) of cinnamon bark changes with weather, maturity of the
stem and growth stage of the plant. However, the physiological reasons behind the
peelability is not understood. The present study was conducted as two experiments.
Experiment I determined the relationship between peelability of cinnamon, and some
related physiological and partial processes of photosynthesis. Following stages of
cinnamon were considered as treatments: fruiting plants with dark green leaves, fruiting
plants with light green leaves, flowering plants with dark green leaves, flowering plants
with light green leaves, flowering plants with dark green leaves (but no flowers in the
given branch), plants with no flowers or fruits. Peelability of cinnamon stems (measured
as the force required to remove bark), fluorescence parameters, leaf water potential,
hydraulic conductivity of the cinnamon sticks and mucilage content of cinnamon barks
were measured. Experiment II examined the relationship between the leaf anthocyanin
content and some fluorescence parameters in cinnamon leaves of different growth stages.
There were significant (P&lt;0.05) differences between the treatments in the force required
for peeling the bark, fluorescence parameters, mucilage content, hydraulic conductivity
and leaf water potential. The force required to detach bark had significant (P&lt;0.05),
positive correlations with fluorescence parameters (Performance index (R2=0.7552),
Fv/Fm (R2=0.6367)) and mucilage content (R2=0.645) and significant (P&lt;0.05) negative
correlation with the leaf water potential (R2=0.3421), but no significant correlation
(P&lt;0.05) with the hydraulic conductivity. Leaf anthocyanin content positively correlated
with absorbance, trapping, and electron transport per reaction center, while light green
leaves appeared to be more efficient photosynthesizers. Cinnamon bark peelability
appears to be negatively correlated with primary metabolism and the products, indicating
possible involvement of secondary metabolic products such as mucilageinpeelability.

Panchagavya is an organic formulation, prepared using cow milk, curd, ghee, cow urine,
and cow dung. It is sprayed on crops with the expectation of suppression of pest
populations and promotion of plant growth. This study was conducted with the objective
of assessing the insecticidal properties and plant growth properties of panchagavya
application on cabbage. The treatments included: 5% concentrated panchagavya applied
at four day intervals (T1), eight day intervals (T2) and DOA recommended insecticide:
chlorantraniliprole 200 g/LSC (Coragen) (T3) with untreated control. The growth of
cabbage plants and population dynamics of cabbage-associated insects were recorded. In
addition, laboratory experiments were conducted to assess antifeedant activity and toxic
effects of punchagavya. There were significant (P&lt;0.05) differences among treatments in
relation to all growth parameters and a comparatively high performance was observed in
T1. Mean stem height, fresh weight of open leaves, fresh weight of unopened leaves
(head), and root weight were 12.13±0.18, 292.34±3.46, 76.69±2.58 and 36.14±1.33,
respectively in T1. The mean larval populations of Spodoptera litura (7.25±1.23),
Crosidolomia binotalis (7.25±1.86) and Trichoplusia ni (8.57±1.604) per plant were
found to be the lowest in T3 where insecticide was applied, followed by T1. The mean
population of the above insects over six weeks in T1 were 11.38±1.72, 11.63±2.18 and
11.85±1.60, respectively. In laboratory tests, a significant (P&lt;0.05) difference was
observed in leaf feeding area between punchagavya-treated (6.25 cm2±0.23/larva) and
untreated control (11.60±0.37 cm2/larva). The mean larval mortality was 60±5.61% in
punchagavya-treated samples and no mortality in the control. With these results, it can
be concluded that the use of punchagavya on cabbage at four day intervals is beneficial.

Codiaeum variegatum ‘Aucubaefolia’ (Baby Croton) has a higher demand as an
ornamental foliage plant in the export market. Rooted and unrooted stem cuttings of
croton are exported. The research was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of rooting
media and Indole – 3 – Butyric Acid (IBA) concentrations on the rooting performance of
C. variegatum ‘Aucubaefolia’ stem cuttings under the production of rooted cuttings and
unrooted cuttings for the export market. Two different rooting media (coir dust and jiffy
pellet) and four different concentrations of IBA (0 mg·L-1, 250 mg·L-1, 500 mg·L-1, and
1000 mg·L-1) were tested. In experiment one, the effect of rooting media and IBA was
evaluated to produce rooted cuttings. In experiment two, the rooting performances of
unrooted cuttings after an export simulation (48 hours of cold storage at 21°C) were
tested. Rooting of croton stem cuttings was significantly affected by rooting media. Jiffy
pellet medium recorded the highest number of roots per cutting, root-to-shoot ratio,
cumulative and root length. Minimum days for root initiation were observed in the coir
dust rooting medium. In experiment one, early rooting and a higher number of roots were
observed in the jiffy pellet medium with 500 mg·L-1 IBA application, while 250 mg·L-1
IBA application was effective in root initiation and 500 mg·L-1 IBA promote the highest
number of roots in coir dust medium. Application of 250 mg·L-1 IBA promoted early
rooting and 500 mg·L-1 IBA promote the highest number of roots in jiffy pellet medium,
while 1000 mg·L-1 IBA application was effective in root initiation and 500 mg·L-1 IBA
promote the highest number of roots in jiffy pellet medium after 48 hours export
simulation. The appropriate rooting media and optimum concentration of IBA would
stimulate the rooting of C. variegatum ‘Aucubaefolia’ stem cuttings.

The crop water requirement during different growing periods may vary significantly
depending on management practices and growth stages. Generally, evapotranspiration
(ET) estimation is a reliable measure to maintain the water uptake and thus an efficient
translocation of plant nutrients. However, direct measurements of the water requirement
(consumptive-use; CU) is less accurate. Under this backdrop, an attempt was made to
validate the available mathematical models for estimating ET of tomato with the aim of
selecting the most appropriate estimation model/s for tropical greenhouse conditions. In
literature, several mathematical models have been introduced for estimating ET, and
compared with actual ET measurements, made using mass difference within a time gap.
In this experiment, tomato plants were grown in coco-peat-bag culture under greenhouse
conditions for making direct ET measurements and gathering climatological data and
plant characteristics (i.e. leaf area) as parameter estimates of models. The latter were used
to estimate ET using two simulation models, and also using the famous Penman-
Monteith (PM) equation. The leaf area of tomato ranged from 0.00189 to 1.3665 m2 plant-
1, while ET varied from 0.175926 to 1.5238 L m-2 day-1 during the two-month period. LAI
varied from 0.0035 to 2.53 during the same period. Model validation resulted best values
for R2 (0.8692 and 0.8145), for RRMSE (5.9 and 15.98 %), and for ME (0.99 and 0.82)
for the simplified model 1(SM1) and PM, respectively. The mean temperature, mean
solar radiation and mean relative humidity prevailed during data collection were 24.5-
29.5 o C, 5.03 -30.6 w m-2 and 66% - 88.1%, respectively. The results showed that the
SM1 and PM model fitted well with the actual evapotranspiration values. However, based
on the results of the model validation, SM1 could be selected better than PM model and
the simplified model 2 for the test conditions with respect to crop and environment.

Evaluating the Morpho-Agronomic Characteristics of Two
Locally-Developed F1 Brinjal Hybrids with an Imported and
Market-Leading Variety

Annual demand for brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) hybrids exceeds the local supply
along with a huge vacuum in the continuous seed production. The lack of knowledge on
the morpho-agronomy of local F1 hybrids may be one of the reasons why the locally-
bred hybrids are less popular compared to the imported hybrids. This experiment was
carried out to evaluate the major morpho-agronomic characteristics of two local brinjal
F1 hybrids namely, ‘EGH-79 (V2)’ and ‘HORDI Lena Iri 1 (V3)’ against that of the
market-leading variety ‘Raveena (V1)’ in a field trial. The final germination percentage
(GP) and mean germination time (MGT) were recorded for a representative set of seeds
of all three varieties. Agronomic data on plant height (PH), leaf blade length and width
(LL and LW, respectively), leaf area (LA), number of branches (NB), canopy diameter
(CD), plant dry weight (DW), number of flowers (NF), number of fruits (NP), fruit yield
(FY), average fruit weight (WF), fruit length and width (FL and FW, respectively),
browning time (BT), and keeping quality (KQ) were recorded at the vegetative (S1), 50%
flowering (S2), 50% fruiting (S3), and full maturity (S4) stages. Morphological
measurements included leaf lobbing pattern, flower/ inflorescence angle, stem color, fruit
and flower color, shape, and size. V3 showed the highest PH, LL, LW, LA, NB, CD,
DW, NF, NP, FY, WF, FL, and FW at all sampling stages and the lowest BT at S3 and
S4 (P&lt;0.05). Physiological data that included net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance,
and intrinsic water-use efficiency supported the agronomic data while morphological
measurements showed minor differences between the varieties. Results concluded that
V3 was the best competitor for V1. However, V3 showed poor seed germination (i.e.
48% GP and MGT 18 days) and KQ characters compared to V2 and/ or V1 and that
warrants further research.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is among the most used leafy vegetables in Sri Lanka. Albert
solution and other inorganic fertilizers are heavily used in lettuce cultivation. There is an
increasing demand for organically grown lettuce because of human health concerns and
environmental hazards due to the overuse of inorganic fertilizers. This study was
conducted to evaluate the use of liquid organic fertilizers (LOF) on the growth and yield
of lettuce. The experiment was laid out using a randomized complete block design
(RCBD) with 5 replicates in a protected plant house at the Agricultural Experimental
Station in Dodangolla, Kundasale. Organic liquid fertilizers, fish tonic, gliricidia leaf
extract, cow dung slurry, jeevamrutha, and Albert’s solution (the control) were used as
the treatments. Two soil types, Immature Brown Loam (IBL) and Reddish Brown Latosol
(RBL) were used as the growing media. The number of leaves, leaf area index, plant
height, plant diameter, chlorophyll content, and leaf nutrients were taken as the growth
and yield parameters, and soil nutrient contents were measured. The results showed that
mean differences in all parameters evaluated were significant among treatments (p &lt;
0.05). Overall growth and yield performances were high in Albert’s solution. The lettuce
yield under Albert’s solution was 24% (dry weight basis) more than with the fish tonic
treatment. Among the LOF, fish tonic and gliricidia mixed with cow dung gave the
highest growth and yield. The chlorophyll content of leaves was high in cow dung
enriched with sugar treatment. Plant nutrient analysis showed that the nutrient content of
lettuce plants has enhanced under the fish tonic and jeevamrutha treatments. The highest
soil nutrient increase was observed under the fish tonic treatment. All the measured
parameters were found high under the IBL medium when compared to the RBL medium.

Fish is an important source of animal protein and other essential required nutrients in
human diets. According to the current nutritional status of Sri Lanka with regards to
eliminating malnourished status, introducing a lower-cost nutrient-rich diet is a must.
With the presence of available resources, freshwater fisheries show great potential to
address the nutrition status in rural communities. The consideration given to the native
fish species in Sri Lanka is comparatively low. Determination of the proximate
composition of fish meat is necessary to prove that it meets requirements for food
regulation and commercial designations. This study was conducted to determine the
moisture, ash, protein, and fat content of selected 05 native fish species in the North
Central province of Sri Lanka. The proximate data were assessed through Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) with a significance level used for all the tests at 95% (p&lt;0.05).
Sampled fish include wild captured, Angula nebulosi (Mottled Eel), Heteropneustes
fossilis (Asian Stinging Catfish), Channa striata (Stripped Snakehead), Anabas
testudineus (Climbing Perch), Eutroplus Suratensis (Green Chromide). The moisture
content ranged from 69.43±1.14% to 82.62±1.77%, ash content varies from 0.94±0.08%
to 1.04±0.28%. The mean protein content of Mottled Eel was 18.29±2.09%, Stinging
Catfish; 16.69±2.09%, Climbing Perch; 18.45±1.56%, Stripped Snakehead;
17.94±1.55% and Green Chromide; 16.18±1.47%. The fat contents were 11.14±2.09%,
0.81±0.16%, 0.85±0.22%, 0.5±0.22% and 0.33±0.04%, respectively. Ash and Protein
contents were not significantly different (p>0.05) within the groups. The obtained protein
values were compared with the secondary data of reservoir-grown Tilapia (Oreochromis
niloticus) in which the highest mean protein value was 16.14±0.01%, and was lower than
the Climbing Perch, Mottled Eel, and Stripped Snakehead. Tilapia's fat content was lower
than Eel's fat content and higher than the other four species. The present study
demonstrated that the flesh of all studied species is rich in nutritional values.

Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench) is a crop belongs to family Malvaceae. Plant
Genetic Resources Centre (PGRC), Peradeniya maintain and conserves 531 okra
accessions collected from different locations of the country. In the present study
characterization 25 of the 531 accessions including a recommended variety “haritha” was
done using 26 morphological characters listed in the descriptors for vegetables and
condiments. The results showed that, minimum average fruit length was 16.2 cm in
accession 793 at table use maturity while maximum average was 30.8cm in accession
3108. Average number of fruits per plant, was maximum 31.6 in accession 1888 and
minimum was 11.4 in accession 3091. Maximum average weight of fresh fruit at table
use maturity was 72.62 g in accession 3094 minimum was 23.62 g in accession 1503.
The dendrogram obtained using morphological characters separated 5 major clusters at a
euclidean distance of 9.04. Cluster 2 was the largest and contained 14 genotypes under
sub clusters. Cluster 5 contained only recommended variety “haritha”. The first two
principal components (PCs) calculated for all characters explained 88.3% of the
morphological variation among the 25 okra accession and recommended variety.
Maximum plant height recorded the highest loading with a positive correlation for PC1.
Number of seeds per fruit and weight of fresh fruit at table use maturity with a positive
loading accounted for a major portion of PC2. According to dunnett multiple comparison
with control 95% confidence level, accessions 3108 and 3094 had P>0.05 than the
recommended variety with regard to fruit length at table use maturity, Fruit width at table
use maturity, Number of fruits per plant, Weight of fresh fruit at table use maturity.

Department of Crop Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Increase of soil productivity through the use of organic fertilizers has gained great
importance in organic food production since soil is the basis of management in
sustainable food production. The composting is an aerobic, microorganism-mediated,
solid-state fermentation process by which different organic materials are transformed into
more stable compounds. The product obtained is the compost, which contributes to the
improvement of physical, chemical and microbiological properties of the soil. However,
the compost usage in agriculture is constrained because of its long-time action and
reduced supply of nutrients to the crops. This study was carried out to evaluate the quality
of compost produced using some rapid composting methods using different materials.
Eight compost formulations containing combinations of ingredients such as inoculant
(mature compost), animal dung (cow dung and poultry manure), green leaves; (Gliricidia
leaves and Tithonia leaves), Eppawala rock phosphate (ERP), saw dust, biochar, banana
stems and straw were prepared under aerobic and anaerobic condition, separately. Total
nitrogen and available phosphorus contents, temperature fluctuation with time and
phytotoxicity of compost were studied. Final compost yield was nearly 1/3 of initial
weight and compost prepared under anaerobic condition performed better compared to
aerobic treatments. Available phosphorous and total nitrogen were higher in compost
prepared using poultry manure as animal dung. pH and electrical conductivity were in
acceptable range for almost all compost formulations. The compost prepared using
poultry manure, Glyricidia without turning produced the best quality in relation to
evaluated parameters. The phytotoxicity of compost was reduced with time. Nearly 50%
of nitrogen loss observed in all mixtures as reported in similar studies conducted
elsewhere.

Selection of a conducive growth medium is indispensable for facilitating the optimal
utilization of nutrients and water for capsicum plant growth and development in grow
bag culture. This pot experiment had three hybrid capsicum varieties namely, “Muria
(V1)”, “Parthana (V2)”, and “CH-19 (V3)” established in three different media
compositions (MC); MC1 (Top Soil: Half Burned Paddy Husk (HBPH): Sand =2:1:1/2),
MC2 (HBPH: Compost: Sand=1:1:1/2), and MC3 (Coconut husk pieces: Compost:
HBPH= 1/2:1:1) from the seedling stage to maximum flowering under optimum growth
conditions. Measurements and analyses included plant height (PH), leaf area index (LAI),
number of flowers and pods (NF and NP, respectively), average pod weight (APW), plant
dry weight (DM), plant nitrogen (Np), phosphorus (Pp), potassium (Kp), soil nitrogen
(Ns), phosphorus (Ps), potassium (Ks) and NPK and water-use efficiency (N*UE and
WUE, respectively). Results from the statistical data analysis revealed that the treatment
combination effect was significant only for Np (p&lt;0.05), Pp (p&lt;0.0001), and Kp (p&lt;0.05)
amongst all measurements taken. The highest plant NPK were recorded for V1MC2,
V2MC3, V3MC2 (Np), V2MC3 (Pp), and V3MC2, V3MC3 (Kp), respectively. DM of
different plant parts were not significantly different between the MCs or varieties
(p>0.05), except for DM of roots (p&lt;0.05) where MC2 showed the highest amongst all.
However, PH, LAI, FN, PN, APW, DM partitioning and Ns, Ps, and Ks economy showed
complex treatment combination effects. Results concluded that WUE of plant vegetative
plant parts, PN, and nitrogen use efficiency were the highest in MC2 and then in MC3
(soil less MCs) for all three varieties. When the cost of production and handling
feasibility are also considered, MC3 was selected as the best MC for V1, V2, and V3
under the conditions tested.

Cloves are important as a spice, medicine, flavoring, or fragrance in consumer products.
Though Sri Lanka is the 8th largest exporter of cloves, the cultivation is basically confined
to 7,618 ha in Kandy, Kegalle, and Matale districts. Clove has proven to be a successful
crop in home gardens with its ability to provide income to families during two seasons
per year at a minimum cost. The lack of suitable lands with the required soil and climatic
conditions is the major constraint to further expanding the commercial cultivation of
cloves in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this study aimed to study the feasibility of commercial
clove cultivation in Gampaha district. The study was conducted in 13 Divisional
Secretariat Divisions (DS). Ninety home gardens were selected for the study of which,
questionnaire survey was conducted in selected 50 home gardens and soil samples were
also collected for the analysis of major soil properties. Interpolated surfaces were
developed for specific climatic parameters and land suitability map for Clove was
developed using Geographic Information System (GIS). Results revealed that clove
cultivation is feasible as monocrop, intercrop, or home garden crop in Gampaha district
except in areas close to the coastal belt. Based on the developed climatic and soil maps,
Mirigama and Dompe are the most suitable areas for clove cultivation. Negambo,
Waththala, and Katana areas are not suitable due to their close vicinity to the coastal belt.
Other DS divisions have moderate suitability for clove cultivation on a commercial scale.
According to cost-benefit analysis, clove cultivation is profitable in Gampaha district
mainly as a home garden crop, and its contribution is significant on the family
income. With support from relevant government authorities and adopting good
management practices, clove can be successfully cultivated in the Gampaha district
except in areas close to the coastal belt.

Estimation of genetic parameters of production and reproductive traits is a pre-requisite
for genetic selection and improvement of dairy herds. The objective of this study was to
determine the factors affecting production and reproductive performance of crossbred
cows raised under semi-intensive management system in the WL1 agroecological zone.
Performance records of 100 cows in 5 parity groups from a large-scale Government farm
in Siringapatha were selected after screening for missing information. The cows were
from four crossbreds genotypes, i.e. Jersey cross, Sahiwal cross, Australian Friesian
Sahiwal cross, and Girolando cross. The traits studied were lactation yield (LY), lactation
length (LL), age at first calving (AFC), number of services per conception (NoS), calving
interval (CI), age at sexual maturity (ASM) and calf birth weight (CBW). Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) procedure was carried out using crossbred genotype, parity, LL, LY,
AFC, NoS, CI, CBW and ASM of cow as fixed effects, and Duncan’s Multiple Range
Test was used for mean comparison. ANOVA based half sib analysis method was used
for heritability estimation. The mean performance values of LY, LL, AFC, NoS, CI,
CBW and ASM of the farm were 958.04 liters, 199 days, 58 months, 1.44 services, 13
months, 18.98kg, and 27.60 months, respectively. There was no significant effect
(P>0.05) of cow genotype on any of the traits owing to greater within breed variability
observed. Cows in the fourth and later parities had significantly higher LY and CBW
than those of lower parities (P&lt;0.05). CI increased significantly with NoS (P&lt;0.05).
ASM had a significant (P&lt;0.05) but weak positive correlation with AFC (r = 0.22). The
heritability estimates of CBW, LL, LY, NoS and AFC were 0.07, 0.24, 0.22, 0.80 and
0.05, respectively showing the evidence of genetic variability existing within the herd for
selection. Improved management conditions could enable revealing of true differences
among the genotypes.

Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative organism of rice blast disease, causes 10-30% annual
yield losses worldwide. Panicle blast is the most severe form, causing 100% yield losses.
This study aimed at identifying blast resistant genes/QTLalleles in selected rice
germplasm and screening the same for leaf and panicle blast resistance in local
environments. Magnaporthe oryzae strains, isolated and Koch’s postulated previously,
were sub-cultured and identified by Pot2 based PCR before inoculation. Two local Mega
rice varieties Bg352 and At362, and international germplasm Usen, Zenith, and Raminad
were studied. Pachchaperumal was used as the susceptible control. Potted rice plants at
seedling (21 days) and heading stages were screened in triplicate for leaf and panicle
blast. Rice plants inoculated by spraying a mycelium suspension of the two-pathogen
isolates were kept in humid chambers to facilitate disease development. Rice varieties
were genotyped using gene-specific markers or linked SSR markers for Pita/Pita-2, Pi54
and Pikh genes/QTL alleles. Optimum growth of M. oryzae was observed on oatmeal
plates containing 7.5 g/L of glucose. Upon inoculation, panicle blast symptoms were
observed on Bg352 and At362, however, no symptoms were observed on Usen, Zenith,
Raminad and Pachchaperumal. Symptom development was not consistent in the
replicates in any of the varieties, therefore, these observations need to be verified.
Pita/Pita-2, Pi54 and Pkih resistance genes/QTLs were observed in Usen, Raminad, and
Zenith respectively. Pita/Pita-2, and Pi54 were amplified in At362 and Bg352. Bg352
predicted allelic variation in Pikh but the QTL was not amplified in At362. Sequencing
of these genes/QTL from the local varieties could reveal further allelic variations.
Verification of resistance phenotypes of Usen, Raminad and Zenith and identification of
allelic variations will assist in identifying potential donor parents for blast resistance in
rice crop improvement.

The photosynthetic mechanism of crops and weeds will determine their competitiveness
and level of resilience in a changing climate. The study assessed the impact of climate
change on the germination and growth performance of Oryza sativa (var. Bg300; C3) and
major weed species in paddy cultivation, i.e. Echinochloa crus-galli and Ischaemum
rugosum (C4 grasses), and Cyperus iria and C. difformis (C3 sedges). Elevated
temperature (T1: day/night 35/33 °C), elevated CO2 concentration (T2: 550 ppm at
day/night 28/26 °C) and the combination of temperature and CO2 concentration (T3: 550
ppm at day/night 35/33 °C) were imposed separately in a growth chamber, coupled with
parallel experiments in the laboratory (CO2 440 ppm; day/night 26/22 °C) and field
conditions (CO2 440 ppm; day/night 28/23 °C). At 3 days after sowing (DAS), seed
germination of paddy and grass weeds showed 100% germination, while the sedges
showed about 90% germination in T1, T2, and T3 compared to laboratory and open field
conditions. The growth parameters such as plant height, root length, number of leaves,
and plant dry weight of paddy plants and sedge weeds were higher at 21 DAS of seed
paddy in T2 with a high leaf greenness (SPAD reading) compared to T1, T3, laboratory,
and field conditions. In a similar comparison, C4 grass weeds performed better (p&lt;0.05)
in T3 with a high SPAD value compared to the rest. The highest leaf area per plant of O.
sativa and sedge weeds was recorded in T2, while that of grass weeds was recorded in
T3, at 21 DAS. The results revealed that C4 grass weeds could pose a severe threat to
paddy cultivation in a changing climate.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different nutrient regimes on the
growth and development of the local tomato variety Thilina. The experiment was carried
out in three environments: a controlled greenhouse, an uncontrolled greenhouse, and an
open field at the Agricultural Biotechnology Center, Meewathura, from September to
November 2022, as separate Randomized Complete Block Designs. Tomato plants were
treated with the Department of Agriculture’s recommended nitrogen fertilizer amounts
as a control (T1), 80% nitrogen from the recommendation (T2), and 60% nitrogen from
the recommendation (T3) in each environment separately. Results revealed that the
highest day (30.8°C) and night (23°C) temperatures were observed in the uncontrolled
greenhouse and the lowest day (27.8°C) and night (19.5°C) temperatures were observed
in the open field environment. The highest relative humidity (81.7%) was observed in the
controlled greenhouse and the lowest (62.2%) was observed in the open field
environment, and the highest incident radiation (7.2 mol (PAR)m-2d-1) was observed in
the open field environment, while the lowest (2.3 mol (PAR)m-2d-1) was observed in the
controlled greenhouse. Sub-optimal nitrogen supply did not show a significant (P&lt;0.05)
effect on all measured growth development and yield parameters in the uncontrolled
greenhouse. Treatment effects were significant for some parameters in the controlled
greenhouse and open field. Total plant dry weight and total plant nitrogen increased under
60% nitrogen, the efficiency of photosynthetic light reaction as measured by chlorophyll
fluorescence and total plant nitrogen was higher under 80% nitrogen compared to the
control (100% nitrogen) in the controlled greenhouse. In the open field environment, both
80% and 60% nitrogen reduced photosynthetic efficiency, whereas 80% nitrogen reduced
the height increase rate compared to the control. It is concluded that the sensitivity of
tomato sub-optimal nitrogen supply varies with the growing environment.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of water stress on selected growth and
development parameters of tomato (variety Thilina). The experiment was carried out in
three environments: a controlled greenhouse, an uncontrolled greenhouse and an open
field at the Agricultural Biotechnology Center, from September to November 2022, as
separate Randomized Complete Block Designs with five replicates. The plants were
grown in pots under three water regimes, namely, well-watered (80% field capacity, FC),
60% and 40% FC. The three environments differed significantly (p&lt;0.0001) in terms of
incident radiation, day and night air temperature and relative humidity. The highest day
(30.8oC) and night (23oC) temperature was observed in the uncontrolled greenhouse
whereas lowest day (27.8oC) and night (19.5oC) temperatures were observed in the open
field environment. The highest relative humidity (81.7%) was observed in the controlled
greenhouse and the lowest (62.2%) was in the open field environment. The highest
incident radiation (7.2 mol (PAR)m-2d-1) was observed in the open field environment and
the lowest (2.3 mol (PAR)m-2d-1) was observed in the controlled greenhouse. Water
stress did not show significant (P&lt;0.05) effects on all measured growth, development,
and yield parameters except leaf temperature 36 days after transplanting in the
uncontrolled greenhouse. Both 60%FC (T2) and 40%FC (T3) increased the leaf surface
temperature compared to the well-watered control (T1) in the uncontrolled greenhouse.
Rate of fruit initiation increased under 60%FC and 40%FC, while 40%FC decreased the
leaf area per plant in the controlled greenhouse. Severe water stress decrease root dry
weight and rate of height increase was decreased under 40%FC, whereas 60%FC
decreased the root dry weight in the open field environment. It is concluded that tomato
plants in the different growing environments show varying sensitivity to water stress.

Drought has been a significant challenge to crop production worldwide, affecting a wide
range of crops via yield losses and crop failures. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the growth and yield performance of selected sesame varieties and breeding
lines cultivated under moisture-stress conditions. A pot experiment was conducted as a
Completely Randomized Design (CRD) in a rain shelter. Two commonly grown sesame
varieties (Uma and Malee) and two promising breeding lines (Ye An and Yupung) were
grown under well-watered and moisture-stressed conditions. All pots were maintained at
80% field capacity until the drought treatment was imposed. The moisture stress was
imposed by drying out the soil without irrigation for several days until leaf wilting
symptoms appeared and then re-watered with half the amount of water to that of 80%
field capacity. Plant growth, uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)
and their use efficiency were measured. Drought had a significant impact on
accumulation of biomass of Malee and Yupung varieties. N uptake of Malee was greatly
reduced under drought and was unable to increase the use efficiency of acquired N under
drought. Although P uptake of Uma was reduced under drought, the use efficiency of
acquired P was greatly enhanced. K uptake of Malee and Yupung was significantly
reduced (P&lt;0.05) under moisture stress, and those cultivars were unable to utilize the
acquired K more efficiently in biomass formation under drought stress. There was a
greater tendency to reduce the pod number of Uma and Malee grown under drought stress
compared to well-watered condition. Drought, on the other hand, had no effect on the
pod length and width of the tested varieties and breeding lines. Uma and Ye An seem to
be more drought tolerant in biomass formation compared to Malee and Yupung.

Finger millet (FM/ Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.) is widely grown in arid and semi-arid
regions around the world to ensure future food and nutritional security as well as a
potential crop for drought-prone cropping lands. FM can be intercropped with legumes
such as green gram (GG/ Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) to enhance the productivity in the
cropping system. This experiment was conducted to investigate the productivity
performance of FM-GG intercropping system under drought stress. In a pot experiment,
two crop species were grown as monocropping and intercropping under two moisture
levels (well-watered and drought). Soil moisture in well-watered condition was
maintained in 80% field capacity whereas drought-stress was imposed with 40%
moisture. Plant dry weight, uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)
and use efficiency of those nutrients, root length, available soil P in rhizosphere soil were
measured. FM produced similar shoot and root dry weight irrespective of the moisture
treatment and cropping system. However, intercropping had no yield advantage either in
well-watered or moisture-stressed condition. Drought stress significantly (P&lt;0.05)
decreased the panicle dry weight of FM. Irrespective of the moisture treatment, FM
grown with GG accumulated more N than those cultivated in monocropping system.
There was no intercropping advantage for P and K accumulation of FM both in drought
and well-watered conditions. From the results, it can be concluded that, FM-GG
intercropping provides only N uptake advantage for FM. However, N uptake advantage
could not translate into yield advantage of FM either in well-watered or moisture-limited
condition.

Rhizobacteria with abilities to solubilize phosphate, fix atmospheric nitrogen and
produce growth hormones enhance growth and yield of crops. A field experiment was
conducted to assess the effectiveness of a rhizobacterial inoculant comprising three
phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and a diazotroph (Azospirillum sp.) on growth and
yield of maize under field conditions. The inoculant was added either to seeds (SI) or to
compost pellets (ICP) and evaluated along with a fertilizer mixture containing urea and
triple super phosphate at 2/3 and 3/4 of recommended rates, respectively and compared
with recommended fertilizer (RF) and non-fertilized treatments. Nitrogen and P
concentrations in leaves and available N and P in soils were analyzed and shoot height
and biomass were recorded at the vegetative growth stage. Cob weights were recorded at
the milky stage. Leaf N and P concentrations of SI and ICP treatments varied from 46 to
52 mg g-1 and from 1.6 to 1.7 mg g-1 dry matter, respectively and comparable to RF
treatment. The same trend was observed for shoot biomass in inoculated (53-64 g) and
RF (59 g) treatments. Plant dry weights correlated with leaf N concentrations (r= 0.68,
P&lt;0.05). Fresh cob weights of inoculated treatments (0.21 – 0.25 kg) were significantly
higher than that of RF treatment (0.2 kg) implying that N and P were not limiting in the
inoculated treatments. A positive correlation between cob weight and soil available P
(r=0.83, P&lt;0.01) and high root infection by arbuscular mycorrhizae resulting in > 78%
of arbuscules implied that yield was limited by the P. Both SI and ICP effectively
enhanced growth and yield of maize irrespective of fertilizer cut down and optimum soil
P levels for maize should be identified.

Aglaonema maria, or "Chinese Evergreen," is an ornamental foliage plant that has high
demand in the export market. The unavailability of a suitable growing medium for large-
scale production is a limitation. A net house experiment was conducted to assess the
effectiveness of adding two types of compost fortified with selected fungal strains to the
existing growth medium at Mike Flora (Pvt.) Ltd., Rambukkana. Four treatments: non-
fortified control (T1), non-fortified compost (T2), Trichoderma harzianum fortified
compost (T3), and compost fortified with a combination of three fungal strains (T4) were
arranged in a completely randomized design. The treatments were added to plant stocks
that had one-month-old healthy plants, and one-year-old and two-year-old plants with
retarded growth. The number of replicates for each treatment was ten. Plant height and
number of leaves per plant were recorded at monthly intervals for two and half months
in 40 representative plants from each plant stock. Both one-month-old and one-year-old
plants showed the highest mean increase in plant height: 33.5 cm and 25.8 cm,
respectively. No significant growth enhancement was observed in two-year-old plants.
Two-year-old plants in T. harzianum fortified compost showed the highest increase in
leaf number due to releasing significantly higher K (404.6 mg kg-1), P (1383 mg kg-1),
NO3- (330.1 mg kg-1), and NH4+ (1097 mg kg-1) by T. harzianum over 30 days period.
This study provided evidence that the compost fortified with T. harzianum could increase
the growth of Aglaonema maria by providing nutrients over non-inoculated compost and
has the potential of being used at a commercial scale.

Systomus spilurus (Mas Pethiya) is an endemic freshwater food fish in Sri Lanka. Due to
its taste and high nutritional value, S. spilurus has been heavily consumed and its natural
population has been declined mainly due to anthropogenic reasons. Though captive
breeding seems a promising method for stock enhancement, larval rearing protocols;
stocking densities in particularly were not tested and optimized under Sri Lankan
conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the most suitable
stocking density in captivity for S. spilurus for introduction of them to culture-based
fishery. In this study, five-day-old S. spilurus Post Larvae (PL) were stocked in 86 cm ×
70 cm × 25 cm cement tanks, and tanks were filled with water up to the height of 10
inches (150 L). There were 4 treatments with different stocking densities of S. spilurus
as 0.75 PL/L (T1), 1.25 PL/L (T2), (T3) 1.75 PL/L (T3) and 2.25 PL/L (T4). All PLs were
fed using Artemia &amp; chicken egg mixture in the first two weeks followed by a formulated
commercial feed (40% crude protein) at levels of 10% and 25% of the body weight,
during the 56-days of experimental period. The mean final weight &amp; length, average daily
weight and length gain, and specific growth rate among treatments were significantly
different (P&lt;0.05). The highest final mean length (3.3±0.01 cm) &amp; weight (0.464±0.013
g), the highest average daily weight gain (0.0083±0.0002 g/day) &amp; length gain
(0.049±0.0002 cm/day) and the highest specific growth rate (10.96±0.005 %/day) were
observed in T1 where the stocking density was lowest at 0.75 PL/L. The lowest growth
performance was observed in the T4 treatment where stocking density was at 2.25 PL/L.
These results conclude that the stocking density of 0.75 PL/L can be used as the best
stocking density for rearing Systomus spilurus PLs in captivity.

Department of Crop Science,

Guava (Psidium guajava Linn.) is one of the principal tropical fruits which is largely
consumed in Sri Lanka in the fresh form. It is also one of the fruits that has a high export
potential. Addressing the question of “health safety of guava fruits” under different crop
management conditions was found to be a timely important topic because consumer
concerns over the fresh fruit quality and health safety have increased substantially in
recent years. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether there is a
correlation between crop management intensity level (High, Medium, Low) and the fruit
qualities and pesticide residue levels of guava. For the qualitative assessments, guava
samples were collected from farmer fields at harvesting maturity stage. Total Soluble
Solid (TSS), titratable Acidity (TA), fruit volume, fruit weight, fruit diameter, fruit
firmness, L*, a*, b* values, and residue levels of commonly used pesticides were
quantified in fresh samples. Residues of pesticides were analyzed by Gas
chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The results indicated that the residues of common
pesticides were not detected in any of the samples. Meanwhile, the crop management
intensity level (High, Medium, Low) was found to be not significant (P&lt;0.05) on the
selected quality parameters of fresh guava. Low rate of application of pesticides due to
high cost and adhering to safety guidelines were found to be the most probable reasons
for this situation. It can be concluded that the present-day crop management in guava
cultivations does not have any harmful effect on fresh fruits with respect to pesticide
residues. However, this conclusion needs verification through repeated studies using a
better sampling strategy, before recommending the health safety of fresh guava fruits in
Sri Lanka.

A multipurpose leguminous tree species native to Mexico known as Gliricidia (Gliricidia
sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp) has traditionally offered goods and services to the farming
people of tropical nations like Sri Lanka. Early on after its introduction in 1700, its
primary purposes included defining fences in farmlands and backyard gardens, providing
shade for coffee, cocoa, and tea cultivation, and providing support for a variety of
climbing crops like pepper, vanilla, yams and vegetables. Gliricidia is currently plays a
significant part of Sri Lanka's agriculture, livestock, and green energy sectors. Since Sri
Lanka has very few prospective hydro-generating sites that are now available for
development, non-traditional renewable energy generation represents a promising option.
To meet future electricity demand, Gliricidia can be used as a biomass energy source,
although there is no proper selection methods for mother plants for higher wood biomass
production. Therefore, the present study was conducted to make Gliricidia mother plant
selection criteria aiming for high amount of fuelwood yield. Out of 12 variables recorded
over 100 Gliricidia trees, only leaf weight, stem girth and average branch girth were
shown positive linear relationship with the wood weight. Relationships between wood
weight (Y1) and leaf weight (X1), stem girth (X2) and average branch girth (X3) are
identified as Y1 = 2.46558 X1 + 7.56337 (R2=72%), Y1 = 5.5036 X2 –
10.19207(R2=31%) and Y1 = 6.80236 X3 – 6.78043 (R2=27%), respectively. According
to multiple linear regression X2 and X3 relationship with Y1 was Y1 = 3.85472 X2 +
4.06939 X3 – 20.06631 (R2=36.9%), whereas the relationship of all three variable was
Y1 = 2.08909 X1 + 1.57609 X2 + 1.87959 X3 – 10.55528 (R2=77.7%). Based on the
results and practicality, it can be concluded that the better approach for selection of
mother plants will be obtaining of wood weight after harvesting.

Seed dormancy is the ability of seeds to delay their germination even under favourable
conditions. Dormancy affects the cultivation and production of rice. This experiment was
conducted to identify the variation of dormancy period of 14 popular rice varieties grown
in eight locations in Sri Lanka. Seeds taken immediately after harvesting were tested for
germination. The stage at which the seeds show 85% of germination was taken as the
dormancy breaking point as per the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA)
guidelines. The experiment was conducted at Seed Certification Service, Gannoruwa,
Peradeniya. The initial moisture content of the seeds (%), thousand seed weight (g), days
taken for 85% germination, days taken for 50% germination, thousand seed dry weight
(g), and shoot and root length of seedlings (cm) were measured. According to the results
of the study, the mean seed dormancy period varied from variety to variety within a range
of 19-85 days after harvesting. Location-wise difference in dormancy period was also
observed for a given variety. Different varieties grown in the same location also showed
differences in the dormancy period. Thousand seed weight and thousand seed dry weight
of varieties varied from location to location but did not show any relationship with the
dormancy period. Mean seedling vigor index (SVI) significantly varied (p=0.05) among
varieties, locations as well as the days after harvesting within each variety. Seeds just
after harvesting had a lower SVI indicating poor seedling quality and reached the
maximum at the dormancy breaking period. Therefore, the study found that the seed
dormancy period of paddy varies among varieties as well as the cultivating area of Sri
Lanka. Moreover, the quality of seedlings is better after the dormancy breaking point.

probable causal organisms. Using a map, the total land area of the UoP was divided into
40 blocks (200 x 200 m), and 10 randomly selected blocks were used for purposive
sampling. Identification was performed using signs and symptoms on diseased plants, as
well as the colony and spore morphology of isolated microorganisms. Leaf spots on
Mangifera indica, Couroupita surinamensis, Michelia champaca, Bridelia retusa,

Horse gram [Macrotyloma uniflorum Lam. (Verdc.)] is a legume which can be easily
grown in Sri Lanka. However, long life cycle duration and poor productivity due to lower
flowering in some growing areas of the country are some of the restrictions in horse gram
cultivation. Due to the higher growth rate of the plant, there is a high potential of horse
gram to be used as a green manure. Therefore, identification of the correct soil
incorporation stage of horse gram as a green manure under Sri Lankan conditions is very
important. With that objective, the experiment was conducted at the University Sub-
campus, Mahailluppallama and horse gram seeds were broadcasted evenly over nine plots
at the rate of 25 Kg ha-1. Then, the plants were cut and biomass was mixed into soil at
three treatment stages as; 6 weeks after sowing (WAS, T1), 8 WAS (T2) and 10 WAS
(T3). Soil samples were collected at treatment imposition and, in one-week intervals after
treatment imposition in three replicate plots per treatment at 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths
and analyzed for nutrients. Simultaneously, plant biomass samples were collected every
week in three replicates. Results revealed that, plant drymatter, N, P and K additions to
the soil with values of 2839.6, 32.15, 6.25 and 24.06 kg ha-1 respectively were
significantly greater (P&lt;0.05) in T3 compared to T1 and T2. The N, P, K levels at the 0-
15 and 15-30 cm depths of soil were greater compared to the initial soil nutrient levels in
the T3 treatment during the period from zero to four weeks after soil incorporation.
Therefore, according to the overall results of the study, 10 WAS can be recommended as
the best stage to incorporate horse gram into soil to get the maximum benefits as green
manure.

The ornamental fishery is a developing sector in Sri Lanka. High cost of production and
loss due to disease conditions are major constraints of the aquaculture sector. Many
chemical compounds including antibiotics are used by farmers to control disease
conditions that are not environmentally sound and cause drug resistance bacteria. The
occurrence of bacterial disease in fish fingerlings is found due to various pathogenic
bacteria and the majority were identified as Aeromonas sp. The application of native
herbal plants in the aquaculture sector is an effective and environmentally friendly
method for enhancing fish immunity and growth. This study was conducted to investigate
effective immunostimulant for koi carp fingerlings among Coriandrum sativum
(Coriander seeds), Osbeckia octandra (Heen bovitiya leaf), and Asparagus racemosus
(Hathawaria leaf). Three feeds were produced by incorporating each plant’s dry powder
with Growfin commercial feed as Feed TK (1% of Coriander seed), Feed TA (1% of
Hathawaria), and Feed TH (1% of Heen bovitiya). Growfin feed was used as the control
Feed (C). The feeding period was six weeks. Growth performance and feed performance
were at the estimated. Blood sampling and a challenge study using Aeromonas
hydrophilla were carried out at the end. In terms of hematological parameters, Red blood
cell count and White blood cells were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in Hathawaria leaf
compared with the control. Hathawaria leaf showed significantly (p&lt;0.05) the highest
specific growth rate (SGR%) and feed conversion ratio FCR 1.8. The hepatosomatic
index (HSI) was significantly (p>0.05) smaller among the treatment groups and the
control showed the highest HSI. In the challenge study, treated groups showed a high
survival rate compared to the control. Among them, Hathawaria treatment showed the
highest survival rate (83.3%). The results showed that the dietary supplement of
Hathawaria can enhance immunity, growth, and resistance against Aeromonas
hydrophilla.

Assuring the nation’s food quality and safety is of utmost importance. Sri Lanka Good
Agricultural Practices (SLGAP) is identified as one of the important steps in achieving
it. SLGAP standards address the food quality and safety, environmental sustainability,
social acceptability and economic viability. However, good agronomic performance is
needed to attract farmers to the SLGAP. The objective of this study was to compare chilli
grown under SLGAP directives and conventional chilli cultivations established in both
lowland rice fields and uplands. Hence, chilli established under 4 treatment combinations
was evaluated. They included SLGAP cultivations in lowland rice fields, conventional
cultivations in lowland rice fields, SLGAP cultivations in uplands and conventional
cultivations in uplands. Each treatment was evaluated using ten cultivations (replicates).
Cultivated chilli variety in all the cultivations was MICH HY1. Agronomic performance
was measured using plant height, yield and disease incidence with special reference to
Leaf Curl Complex (LCC) and Narrow Leaf Disorder (NLD). In both cultivations the
SLGAP-certification and conventional, the recorded yields were high (p&lt;0.05) under
upland conditions when compared to lowland rice fields. The yield differences between
SLGAP and conventional cultivations were non-significant (p>0.05) under upland
conditions. SLGAP cultivations recorded significantly high (p&lt;0.05) yields when
compared to conventional cultivations when grown in the lowland rice fields. It was
observed that LCC was high (p&lt;0.05) under conventional cultivations when compared to
SLGAP cultivations both under upland conditions and lowland rice fields. The NLD
incidence was high (p&lt;0.05) in lowland rice fields when compared to uplands in both
SLGAP and conventional cultivations. Hence it is apparent that practicing SLGAP
standards is beneficial to obtain high agronomic performances and low disease incidences
with reference to LCC and NLD when establishing chilli cultivations in uplands in the
DL1b agro-ecological region of Sri Lanka.

Exacum trinervium is a small flowering herb and an endemic to Sri Lanka. In vitro
flowering provide the opportunity to study flowering requirements of a given species
which can be used to overcome problems associated with flowering. In the present study
effect of 3 different concentrations (3%, 6% and 9%) of sucrose, medium strength (half
and full strength MS) and paclobutrazol (0.1 mg/l) on in vitro flowering of E. trinervium
was investigated. Shoot length, leaf numbers, fresh and dry weight of the shoots and
chlorophyll content were measured for10 week period. Results showed a significant
variation between some treatments. Sucrose concentration affected on shoot length, leaf
number and chlorophyll content of the shoots. The highest (P&lt;0.05) shoot length, leaf
number and chlorophyll content were obtained in the plants grown on 3% sucrose
concentration. Different sucrose concentrations had no effect on the fresh and dry weights
of the shoots. The application of paclobutrazol reduced shoot length, internode length
and leaf area significantly (P&lt;0.05) compared to the plants grown without it. Half
strength had no significant effect on shoot growth. High sucrose concentration (9%) was
not favorable for in vitro growth of E. trinervium and 0.1 mg/L paclobutrazol application
reduced the shoot length of E. trinervium. None of the treatment used in this study not
induce in vitro flowering of E. trinervium until 11 weeks after initiation of the experiment.

The current project is aimed at developing a micropropagation protocol for Gracilaria
canaliculata, an economically important red algae for mass rearing of propagules for
conservation and commercialization. Specimens were collected from Dondra Bay, Sri
Lanka. Explants with meristematic growth were identified by macroscopy and
microscopy; by studying cross-sections of young tips and mature stems to identify
meristematic tissues. The experimental design was a CRD, with a minimum of ten
replicates. Two previously recorded sterilization protocols for other seaweeds were tested
with six modifications (T1-T6) under different betadine, ethanol, antibiotics, fungicide
concentrations and incubation periods. Survival rates and pigment retention were
recorded for 30 days. Data at ten day intervals were analyzed by a Chi-square test using
SAS package. Pigment retention rate was graphically illustrated with a heatmap done
using R software. A three-factor factorial experiment was designed for regeneration using
previously utilized two protocols with four modifications (M1-M4) for Provasoli’s
enriched seawater and full MS media under different light-dark conditions, agar levels
(1.5%, 0.75%, 0%) and hormones (NAA: BAP; 1:1, 2:1). Distal immature tips with
meristematic growth were selected as explants. Overall, 0%, 75%, 55%, 34%, 35%, and
38% survival rates were recorded for T1 to T6, respectively and T6 (1-hr incubation in
0.5% Thiram fungicide and antibiotic mixture; 100 mgL-1 Streptomycin, Penicillin and
15% ethanol) was identified as the best. Explant survival rates significantly (P≤0.05)
differed among sterilization methods on the 10th and 20th days after culturing. Explants
of M4 (Full MS, 0.75% agar, light:dark; 16:8) regenerated from the meristematic regions
five days after culturing. However, photosynthetic pigments of explants depleted over
time resulting in a colorless but live explant in cultures. Our results revealed the
possibility of micropropagation of G. canaliculata. Further improvements recommended
for commercialized regeneration and conservation.

Influence of Long-Term Application of Organic Amendments on Soil
Thermal Properties in Tea Grown Soils
Peiris T.T.K., Vidana Gamage D.N.* and Mohotti K.M.1
Department of Soil Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Long-term application of organic amendments to soil may alter soil thermal properties,
modifying soil's ability to buffer against extreme temperature changes. The long-term
effects of application of organic amendments on thermal properties of tea-grown soils,
particularly the impact of different types of organic amendments compared to
conventional synthetic fertilizer application, remain unstudied. Therefore, this study
compared soil thermal properties in tea grown soils treated with Tea waste (TW),
Compost (COM), and Neem oil cake (NOC) and only conventional synthetic fertilizers
(CONV) in a twenty-five-year-old experimental site (“TRI-OR-CON”) at St. Coombs
estate of Tea Research Institute Thalawakale. In total, 48 intact soil core samples and 48
minimally disturbed samples were collected from the surface (0-15 cm) and the
subsurface (15-30 cm). Soil samples were analyzed for soil thermal properties, bulk
density, aggregate stability, volumetric water content at saturation and field capacity, and
soil organic carbon. The incorporation of tea waste and compost into soil over a period
of 25 years resulted in significant (p&lt;0.05) improvements in soil aggregation and a
decrease in bulk density, leading to substantial reductions in soil thermal conductivity
and thermal diffusivity of surface soil compared to conventional synthetic fertilizer
application. Further, soil volumetric heat capacity slightly increased in tea waste and
compost applied soils due to their significantly high soil organic carbon and water
storage. Results of this study suggested that the long-term application of tea waste and
compost has increased soil’s ability to buffer against extreme temperature changes and
thereby to keep temperature of soil more stable favoring increased microbial activity and
an overall healthy tea soil ecosystem. Future studies should consider monitoring the soil
temperature at multiple depths at seasonal to annual temporal scales along with
physiological responses of the tea plants.

Several hybrid fodder sorghum and Napier cultivars have been recently introduced to Sri
Lanka for dairy cattle feeding. Present study investigated the initial growth and nutrient
contents of two hybrid Napier cultivars and a hybrid sorghum cultivar in the mid country,
wet zone during Maha season. The land was prepared, and the experimental plots (25 m2)
were arranged in to a Randomized Complete Block Design with 4 replicates. Double-
node stem cuttings of CO-5 (Pennisetumglaucum x P. purpureumSchumach) and Red
Napier (Pennisetum purpureumcross) were planted in 30 x 30 x 30 cm holes (2 cuttings
per hole) at 1 x 1 m spacing. Sugargraze (Sorghum bicolor cv. Sugargraze) seeds were
planted (2 seeds/ hole) at 2 cm depth at 15 x 45 cm spacing. The height and density of
plants/ shoots and the length, width and density of leaves were measured, weekly. When
Sugargraze reached 25% flowering stage (9th week) all fodder cultivars were harvested.
The yield and nutrient contents of the harvest was estimated using randomly selected
samples. The effect of variety, age and their interaction were significant (P&lt;0.05) on
growth parameters. At 9th week, the height, plants/ shoots density and leaf density were
the highest (P&lt;0.05) for Sugargraze (113.74 cm, 33.00, 251.25, respectively) followed
by CO5 and Red Napier. The effect of variety was significant (P&lt;0.05) on yield and
composition of the harvest. Sugargraze harvest had higher(P&lt;0.05) dry matter (15.44 %)
and organic matter (90.32 %) contents than those in CO5 and Red Napier. Further,
Sugergraze recorded the highest (P&lt;0.05) fresh matter and dry matter yields (22.08
MT/ha, 3.43 MT/ha, respectively) owing to high plant and leaf densities observed.
Harvesting Red Napier and CO5 cultivars after 9 weeks age with greater dry matter
content may result in higher dry matter yield.

The cultivation of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) in Sri Lanka has been criticized for its
higher water consumption and drying out of the landscape, depletion of soil properties,
and loss of biodiversity. The government banned the cultivation of oil palm in 2021 due
to public pressure without proper scientific investigation. Thus, this experiment was
conducted to compare the crop water usage of 10-12 years old oil palm and rubber (Hevea
brasiliensis) plantations at Nakiyadeniya and Sapumalkanda Estates in the Low Country
Wet Zone of Sri Lanka. The Implexx Sap Flow Sensors (ISFS) that employs the heat
pulse technique to assess sap flow and plant water relations of perennial plants were
established in 3 leaf bases (from the top, middle and lower leaf layers of the canopy) of
oil palm and in stem around 1.6 m height from tree-base of rubber plants in the same
location. The water usage was recorded continuously for one week period simultaneously
in both oil palm and rubber trees during October – November 2022 in both estates. The
daily water usages of the oil palm and rubber trees in Nakiyadeniya Estate were 239.49
L/day and 42.17 L/day, respectively, while in Sapumalkanda Estate it was 277.94 L/day
and 53.07 L/day, respectively. Though the daily water usage of a single oil palm and a
rubber tree was significantly different (p&lt;0.05), the water usage per unit land area for oil
palm ranged from 31,070-36,000 L/ha/day while that for rubber ranged from 22,000 –
27,825 L/ha/day. At the time of measurements, the canopy of the rubber plants had not
reached the fully mature state after re-foliation and were also infested with PESTA leaf
disease. Therefore, the water usage values obtained for rubber may be an underestimation
which need to be repeated before any generalization is made.

Calving performance of dairy buffalo is crucial for productivity of the dairy industry.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the calving performances of crossbred
Murrah buffaloes under large scale semi intensive management conditions in the Dry
Zone and to estimate heritability for calving traits of such a herd for genetic selection. A
crossbred Murrah herd (≥50% Murrah) in a large-scale Government farm in Polonnaruwa
district was selected for the study. The records on animal ID, birth date, parity group
(PG = 1, 2, 3, 4, >4 parities), age at first calving (AFC), calf birth weight (CBW), sex of
calf (SOC), birth month and calving interval (CI) were collected on 298 Murrah crossbred
buffalo cows covering the calf birth year period from 2017 to 2021. Mean values (±SE)
of CBW, AFC and CI of the herd were 24.79±0.09 kg, 88.67±1.36 months, and
457.50±6.17 days, respectively. ANOVA procedure followed by Duncan’s Multiple
Range Test showed significant differences (P&lt;0.05) in CBW between male calves
(25.48kg) and female calves (24.81kg). The CBW of fourth and fifth parity groups were
significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher (25.62 and 26.33kg, respectively) than those of first, second
and third parities (24.36, 24.85, and 25.23 kg, respectively). There was no significant
effect of parity of the cow or SOC born on subsequent CI of cows (P>0.05). Chi square
analysis showed that calf birth type (normal, abortions and still birth) was not
significantly associated with PG (P>0.05). December-May season had significantly
higher calving than June-November season (P&lt;0.05). Half sib analysis showed that
heritability estimates for CBW and CI were 0.46 and 0.47, respectively. These results
show the existence of sufficient additive genetic variation to launch within herd selection
and the potential to enhance the performance further through improved management
conditions.

Semen produced by the breeding bulls in the Central Artificial Insemination Station
(CAIS), Kundasale, Sri Lanka is widely used for Artificial Insemination (AI) throughout
the country. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the quality of semen of those bulls as it affects
the number of straws produced from one ejaculate and conception rates at the field level.
The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare AI sires, sire breeds, seasons,
calendar years, and months of semen collection with respect to semen quality
characteristics. Records on a total of 8436 semen samples of 23 AI bulls collected
between 2018 and 2021 were obtained from CAIS. Volume of semen (mL), sperm
concentration (millions/mL), initial motility (%) and post-thawing motility (%) were
analyzed using Analysis of variance procedure with Duncan’s Multiple Range Test for
mean comparison. The overall means of semen volume, sperm concentration, initial
motility, and post-thawing motility were 5.11 mL, 734.24 millions/mL, 75.73%, and
56.70%, respectively. Semen volume was significantly (P&lt;0.05) affected by AI sire, sire
breed, season, year, and month of semen collection. Significant (P&lt;0.05) differences
were observed among AI sires, years, seasons, and months for sperm concentration.
Sperm concentration had a significantly (P&lt;0.05) negative correlation with semen
volume (r =0.1). Maha (October-March) season recorded significantly (P&lt;0.05) a higher
mean semen volume (5.36 mL) and a lower mean concentration (710.1 millions/mL) than
Yala (April-September) season (4.88 mL, and 756.1 millions/mL, respectively). Initial
motility was significantly influenced by all of the factors considered above. The
difference among seasons was not significant (P&lt;0.05) for post-thawing motility. Post-
thawing motility had a significantly (P&lt;0.05) positive correlation with initial motility
(r=0.36). This study revealed that although the semen quality- parameters of all sires
considered were above the minimum standards required, potential exists to improve sire
performance further by providing better management conditions.

Iron (Fe) toxicity is recognized as one of the widely observed soil nutritional disorders,
which lowers rice yield, especially in the low country wet zone (LCWZ) of Sri Lanka.
This experiment was conducted to study the morphological and biochemical
characteristics of selected rice varieties, recommended to be grown in LCWZ, under
variable Fe concentrations in the growing media. The experiment was conducted at the
Regional Rice Research and Development Center at Bombuwala, Sri Lanka (6°57’’ N,
80°.01’’ E) as a hydroponic system from September to December 2022. This trial was
laid out in a Completely Randomized Design. There were two factors. Factor one was
the iron concentration with 4 levels; 0 mg L−1, 100 mg L−1 (1.79×10−3 mol L−1), 300 mg
L−1 (5.372×10−3 mol L−1), and 500 mg L−1 (8.953×10−3 mol L−1). The second factor was
varieties with 4 levels; Bw 267-3, Bw 272-6b, Bw 372, and Bg 359. There were 15 plants
from each treatment combination. Iron toxicity of plants was scored on 0 to 9 scale
according to the standard evaluation system. Bw 372 and Bw 267-3 did not show
bronzing symptoms in any iron concentration. When increasing Fe concentration in the
growing medium, concentrations of Fe and Co were increased in the shoots of all
varieties. However, the concentrations of Cd and Mn were decreased in all varieties.
Reduction in shoot dry weight (SDW) and root length (RL) was the lowest in Bw 372
(33% for SDW and 40% for RL), and highest in Bw 272-6b (64% for SDW and 52% for
RL). When comparing varieties, the concentration of Fe in Bw 372 was the lowest and
Bw 272-6b was the highest. These traits have contributed Bw 272-6b to be susceptible,
and Bw 372 to be tolerant to Fe toxicity.

effective inoculants for soybean. Four strains of indigenous Bradyrhizobium (T5-T7)
isolated from root nodules and rhizosphere soil of soybean were assessed under field
conditions with 50% urea cut down and compared with no fertilized control (T1), non-
inoculated fertilized control (T2), and farmer practice (T3). Plant samples were taken on
the 4th, 6th and 8th weeks after seeding and assessed for dry weight, shoot nitrogen uptake,
and nodules. Data were subjected to Analysis of variance using SPSS statistical software.
Shoot dry weight was significantly higher in treatment added with inoculant 4 (T7) at the
4th (13.10g) and 6th weeks (25.21g) of seeding than other treatments. The same treatment
showed significantly higher total nitrogen in the shoot (66.41 g kg-1) at 4th week and
weight of fresh nodules (0.69 g) at the 6th week over other treatments. The dry weight of
pods was significantly higher in T7 (12.84 g) compared to the other treatments.
Correlation analysis indicated that the shoot and root growth depend on total N uptake (r
= 0.81 and r= 0.85 respectively) and spade meter readings (r = 0.60). At the 6th week,
shoot growth was correlated with the weight of good nodules (r=0.81) and dry weight of
pods (r=0.76). Results indicated that four Bradyrhizobium isolate survived in the
experimental field and developed effective root nodules contributing to a significant
increase in N uptake, growth, and yield enhancement of soybean with a 50% cut down
of urea. There is a high potential to use the seed inoculant at a commercial scale following
testing at farmer fields.

There is a wide variety of edible and non-edible legumes in Sri Lanka which perform
symbiotic Nitrogen (N) fixation with native rhizobia. There are only a few studies that
have been reported on non-edible legume - rhizobia systems in Sri Lanka. The main
objective of the current study is to isolate and screen native rhizobia species which are
well adapted to local climatic and soil conditions from the root nodules of non-edible
legumes to formulate efficient and robust N biofertilizers for edible legume cultivation
in Sri Lanka. Root nodules were collected from seven different non-edible legume plants
(Buffalo clover, Sickle Senna, White lead tree, Wild Indigo, Sleeping Grass, Tick-trefoil,
and Jewel Vine) from seven different locations in Anuradhapura district
(Thambuttegama, Thalawa, Anuradhapura New Town, Mihinthale, Mahailluppallama,
Galnewa, and Kekirawa). Sixteen rhizobial strains were isolated. Nine of them
demonstrated capability of N fixation, inorganic phosphate solubilization, and indole
acetic acid production. These nine strains were tested for their tolerance to adverse
environmental conditions, such as extreme pH, salinity, drought, and high temperature.
Three isolates (TBII-1, TBAS-2, and KEPT-1) had the highest tolerance to extreme saline
(5.0%) conditions. TBII-1 and KEPT-1 grew well at 45 0C due to their tolerance to higher
temperatures. KEPT-1 had the best survival at 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4% of PEG
concentration. Most of the isolates showed optimum growth in the range of pH 5 to 8.
Out of the 16 rhizobial strains isolated, 3 strains (TBII-1, TBAS-2, and KEPT-1) showed
the best survival under the tested extreme environmental conditions and possessed
growth-promoting abilities. Therefore, these 3 strains can be concluded as possible
candidates to produce biofertilizers for edible legume cultivation in Anuradhapura
district of Sri Lanka upon testing of competency in host plant infectivity, nodulation and
plant growth promotion.

Soil salinity is one of the inherent problems in coastal soils. Increased soil salinity in
coastal soils results in low bacterial diversity. However, the salt tolerant bacteria have the
ability to survive in saline soils because of their unique salt tolerant mechanisms. The
current study was focused on identifying salinity tolerant bacteria in the West coast of
Sri Lanka. Four soil samples each were collected from three locations; Negombo lagoon,
Balapitiya coastal area and Beruwala coastal area. From 12 soil samples, 20 bacterial
isolates were obtained, namely NE01 to NE09 (Negombo lagoon), BA01 to BA07
(Balapitiya coastal area) and BE01 to BE04 (Beruwala coastal area). The isolates were
characterized based on bacterial colony morphology, Gram’s stain and biochemical tests
namely, catalase test, modified oxidase test, hemolytic reaction on blood agar and growth
on MacConkey agar. All the bacterial isolates were screened for salt tolerance at different
concentrations of NaCl ranging from 3 dS/m to 18 dS/m. All 20 bacterial isolates were
found to be salt tolerant upto the highest NaCl concentration tested (18 dS/m). The
salinity tolerance behavior of selected five isolates were observed by enumerating the
number of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) with increasing salinity.
Molecular identification of these five isolates were carried out by sequencing the 16S
rRNA gene. It is recommended to screen the identified salt tolerant bacterial isolates for
their plant growth promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) activities such as phosphate
solubilization, indole acetic acid and ammonia production. The findings reveal a potential
of using these isolates through biotechnological applications with the aim of increasing
the productivity of saline affected soils of Sri Lanka.

Management of Southern Blight of Watermelon Caused by Sclerotium
rolfsii using Fragmented DNA and Non-Viable Mycelia of the Pathogen

Department of Agricultural Biology,

Southern Blight (SB) is caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium rolfsii. As a
biological control strategy, host plant immunity can be triggered by exogenous
application of molecular patterns associated with pathogens. Such Pathogen Associated
Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) act as biological elicitors in inducing host plant immunity.
The present study aims to determine the potential of DNA and non-viable mycelial
fragments of S. rolfsii to manage SB and synthesize host defense enzymes towards
induced plant immunity. Genomic DNA of S. rolfsii was fragmented by chemical and
physical methods and the viability of the pathogen was inactivated by dry heat, moist
heat, UV radiation and freezing. Loss of viability of S. rolfsii was confirmed in vitro and
in vivo. Watermelon seedlings (var. Sugar baby) were treated with non-viable mycelial
fragments (0.1 g/seedling) of S. rolfsii, subsequently inoculated with S. rolfsii and after
seven days, percentage disease incidence (DI) was calculated. Separate sets of seedlings
were applied with suspensions of DNA and non-viable mycelial fragments, having
concentrations of 784 ng/µL and 0.04 g/mL, respectively. Activity of defense enzymes
(i.e. peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and chitinase) was quantified four days after the
treatment. Pathogen-inoculated seedlings treated with DNA or mycelial fragments,
reported less than 22% DI in comparison to 60% DI in seedlings only inoculated with the
pathogen. Defense enzyme activity is significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in seedlings treated
with DNA and mycelial fragments than the untreated controls. The highest chitinase
activity was reported by the seedlings treated with fragmented DNA and frozen mycelial
fragments. Fragmented DNA and dry-heated mycelial fragments, respectively resulted in
the highest peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities. Results revealed the possibility
of using DNA and non-viable mycelial fragments of the S. rolfsii to reduce SB of
watermelon and enhance plant defense enzymes.

Methane is a major greenhouse gas (GHG) produced by ruminants, which affects the
world climate change with a global warming potential (GWP) of 25 CO2 equivalents.
This study assessed the ability of Gliricidia sepium (GS) and Brewer’s yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SC) in mitigating the enteric methane production in
Holstein Friesian heifers. The experiment was conducted as a 4×4 Latin square crossover
design, using four non-lactating purebred Holstein Friesian heifers of the same age with
an initial body weight of 370.5±13.2 kg. Four dietary treatments: (A); basal total mixed
ration (TMR), (B); TMR+10 g of SC, (C); TMR replaced by 30% of GS and (D); TMR
replaced by 30% of GS+10 g of SC were fed to the four heifers in a rotational manner
during four test periods. Methane measurements were taken on the first and the seventh
day of test periods, using the Syngas Analyser Gasboard-3100P. Significantly lower
(P=0.007) methane emissions were showed by heifers fed with diets B, C and D.
Moreover, total methane emission was reduced by 81.07%, 65.05% and 54.88% in
treatments B, C and D, respectively compared to the treatment A. No significant
difference (P=0.16) in dry matter intake (DMI) by heifers was observed among the
treatments. Treatments B, C and D showed significantly higher apparent dry matter
digestibility (ADMD) (P=0.009), apparent crude protein digestibility (ACPD) (P=0.005),
apparent neutral detergent fibre digestibility (ANDFD) (P=0.009) and apparent soluble
carbohydrate digestibility (ASCD) (P=0.025). A significantly higher (P=0.018) apparent
acid detergent fibre digestibility (AADFD) was observed in heifers with diets B and D.
Strong negative correlation coefficients were detected between methane emission
percentages of dietary treatments with ADMD (r=-0.98), ACPD (r=-0.96), ANDFD (r=-
0.98), ASCD (r=-0.98) and AADFD (r=-0.92). This study manifests the potential of
dietary inclusion of GS and SC to mitigate the enteric methane production in non-
lactating purebred Holstein Friesian heifers.

Condition

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Plant available P remains low in rice-grown paddy soils regardless of phosphorus
fertilizer application. Mobility of P from fertilizer source to soils under submerged
condition is not well understood. We investigated the availability and mobility of P from
triple super phosphate (TSP) and Eppawala rock phosphate (ERP) in three soils, Alfisol,
Entisol and Ultisol under submerged conditions using soil columns. Fertilizer
granule/pellet equivalent to 10 mg of P was incorporated at the middle 1 cm below the
surface of soil column. (A control without fertilizer incorporation was maintained for
each soil.) The soil columns were submerged for five weeks with 1 cm water head. The
redox potential (Eh) of the soils were measured weekly. At the end of the submergence
period, soil samples were collected at 0-1, 1-2 and 2-3 cm away from the point of P
application horizontally and at the same depths. Soils were analyzed for pH, soil P
fractions extracted by distilled water, 0.5M NaHCO3, 0.1M NaOH and 1M HCl, and
residual. The Eh was -150, 265 and 465 mV at the end of submergence for Ultisol, Alfisol
and Entisol, respectively. Entisol and Ultisols had similar amount of labile P (~30%) and
Alfisols had the lowest amount of labile P (24%) released / mobilized from TSP within
3 cm depth. The labile P fraction was less than 5% in ERP-added soils. Labile P
concentrations within/at the three depths were not significantly different. During
submergence, Fe associated P reduced and Ca associated P increased in all three soils
regardless of P source, and it was more prominent in Ultisol. About 70-76 % of P in TSP
and >95 % in ERP were either remaining in the fertilizer source without releasing to the
soils or immobilized in soil. Developing methods to increase mobility of P from fertilizers
and soils is crucial to increase P fertilizer use efficiency.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Lactation curve modelling is useful for obtaining complete 305-day lactation yields from
incomplete lactation records. The objective of this study was to determine the most
suitable lactation model, out of three widely used models, for the crosssbred Murrah
buffaloes in the North Central Province and thereby to estimate mature equivalent factors
for different parities. A set of 10,563 daily milk yield records were collected from 93
crossbred Murrah buffaloes in a semi intensively managed NLDB farm (Polonnaruwa
farm) in DL1 agro-ecological zone. Three popular mathematical models selected from
the literature namely Gaines (GN), Wood (WD), and Brody2 (BD2) were fitted to daily
milk yield (dependent) and days-in milk (independent) data using non-linear regression
procedure (PROC NLIN) in SAS software, for individual parity groups (1, 2, 3, 4, and
>4 parities). The model parameters a, b and c were determined when the convergence
criterion was met under the Gauss-Newton iterative procedure. Coefficients of
determination (R2) as well as Mean Square Error (MSE) were used as the selection
criteria in selecting the best model. All three models showed reasonable fits to all parities
(R2>0.78), however, WD model fitted early lactation data poorly by overestimating them,
which may be partly due to lack of early lactation yield records in the data set. Based on
the lowest MSE and highest R2 values recorded, BD2 model was found to provide the
best fits for all parity groups. Subsequently, mature equivalent factors were calculated
based on the total 305-day predicted yields obtained from the BD2 model. The mature
equivalent factors for the five parity groups were 0.73, 0.86, 1.0, 0.89, 0.77, respectively
showing that third parity cows providing the highest yields. According to the results,
BD2 model could be recommended as a suitable formula for lactation curve modelling
in the present farm and for farms with similar climatic and management systems.

Molecular Identification of Endemic Medicinal Herb Rhinacanthus
flavovirens based on Chloroplast DNA Barcodes

Rhinacanthus is an important genus that belongs to the family Acanthaceae. Species in
this genus are used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of disease conditions.
However, the presence of similar morphological characters makes identification
and recognition of endemic R. flavovirens from R. nasutus difficult at an early
stage. Therefore, the objective of this study was to construct an efficient DNA barcode
that could discriminate R. flavovirens from the closely related species, R. nasutus. In this
study, we used the chloroplast DNA marker rbcL to distinguish these two species. As
genomic DNA from Rhinacanthus leaves indicated contamination of secondary
metabolites that prevented PCR, this study attempted to optimize CTAB-based and SDS-
based DNA isolation protocols. The CTAB method with few modifications yielded high-
quality DNA in sufficient quantities for PCR. The PCR program was optimized to
produce robust and reproducible amplicons using specific primers from the rbcL region
and subsequently the PCR products were sequenced through Sanger sequencing. The
rbcL sequence of R. flavovirens was compared with the rbcL sequences of R. nasutus
retrieved from NCBI GenBank, and the efficacy of barcoding was evaluated. The results
revealed only 2 variable sites between R. flavovirens and R. nasutus at rbcL marker. The
smallest pairwise distances (0.0095) were found between R. flavovirens and R. nasutus
voucher PS0730MT01 and R. nasutus CHULA-065. Phylogenetic analysis showed a
sister relationship between R. flavovirens and R. nasutus vouchers, however the complete
phylogeny of Rhinacanthus species could not be resolved. Overall, our results indicated
that the universal barcoding region rbcL does not discriminate R. flavovirens from its
close relative R. nasutus.

Productivity of most potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) varieties are compromised in
drought resulting the research need for investigating the drought tolerance properties of
potential varieties in order to expand the cultivation extent in future. A pot experiment
was conducted to evaluate the morpho-physiological responses of the most popular local
potato variety against the 2 imported drought-resistant varieties during the early tuber
bulking stage in both the optimum and imposed drought conditions. Sprouted seed
potatoes of 3 varieties (Granola; V1, Prada; V2, Royal; V3) were established in UV
treated polythene bags filled with soil less media (Compost: Half-burnt paddy husk:
sand=1:1:1/2) and arranged in a completely randomized design with 3 replicates in a
polytunnel. Water treatments were started at the fourth week or at the peak stolon
initiation stage (Control; T1; 40%-60% field capacity; FC and Drought; T2; 20-40% FC).
Morphological (i.e. plant height; PH, leaf area; LA), physiological (i.e. gas exchange;
GE, leaf relative water content; RWC, chlorophyll content; Ch, chlorophyll fluorescence;
CF), and agronomic (i.e. plant dry weight; DM, water-use efficiency; WUE, Stolon and
tuber number; STN and TN, respectively) data were recorded and statistically analyzed.
In results, V2 and V1 had the highest PH, LA, GE, RWC, DM, WUE, STN, and TN in
T1 and T2, respectively, at p&lt;0.05. For all the measurements taken, V3 exhibited a
moderate level of responses to that of V1 and V2 in both T1 and T2. For Ch, and CF, all
3 varieties responded equally in both T1 and T2 (p>0.05). V1 had the lowest percentage
reduction for tuber and stolon DM and the highest increase for WUE at T2 compared to
that at T1. Results concluded that V1 is a promising drought-tolerant potato variety
compared to that of the designated drought-resistant varieties; V2 and V3.

Sustainable production of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is threatened due to the
occurrences of frequent drought spells under the consequences of climate change.
Therefore, it is a must for potato breeders to look for drought-tolerant varieties for future
purposes and that may help potato farmers with expanding the cultivation areas, seasons,
and productivity. This pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the promising morpho-
physiological responses of the most popular local potato variety (Granola; V1) against
that of two imported drought-resistant varieties (Prada; V2, Royal; V3) during the late
tuber bulking stage in both the optimum (Control; T1; 40-60% field capacity; FC) and
imposed drought (Drought; T2; 20-40% FC) conditions. Sprouted seed potatoes were
established in black polythene bags filled with soilless media (Compost: Half-burnt
paddy husk: sand=1:1:1/2) at FC and arranged in a completely randomized design with
three replicates. Treatments were started at the peak of the stolon initiation stage and
morphological (i.e. plant height; PH, leaf area; LA), physiological (i.e. mid-day leaf water
potential; LWP, leaf tissue osmolality; OS, leaf relative water content; RWC), and
agronomic (i.e. plant dry weight; DM, harvest index; HI, water-use efficiency; WUE,
Stolon and tuber number; STN and TN, respectively, volumetric soil moisture content;
SMC) data were recorded and statistically analyzed. Results showed that V3 and V1 had
the highest PH, LA, DM, WUE, STN, and TN in T1 and T2, respectively (p&lt;0.05). For
RWC, LWP, OS, and SMC, all three varieties responded equally in T2 compared to that
in T1 (p>0.05). Overall, V1 had the lowest degree of reduction for DM, HI, and growth
physiology, and the highest increase for WUE in T2 compared to that in T1. Results
concluded that V1 carries better drought tolerance properties compared to that V3 or V2
under the conditions tested.

Neem, Mahua and Sesame Seed Cakes, and Tamarind Husk Powder on
Improving Nitrogen-Use Efficiency in Rice Variety Bg 300 Grown in
Reddish-Brown Earth Soil

The rate of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application depends on the crop species and expected
yield. When applying N fertilizers, it is important to improve N-use efficiency (NUE)
and minimize the negative impacts to the environment. Therefore, this experiment was
conducted to examine the possibilities of improving NUE of rice variety Bg 300 when
grown in reddish brown earth (RBE) soil after mixing urea with plant-based by-products.
For this, field and pot experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block
design at Mahailluppallama, Anuradhapura. The treatments were, control without urea
application (C), urea alone (U), urea + neem (UN), urea + mahua (UM), urea + sesame
(US) and urea + tamarind (UT). Neem, mahua and sesame seed cakes, and tamarind husk
powder were mixed with urea at 1:5 ratio (w/w) for each application. Fertilizer
application was made according to the recommendation of the Department of
Agriculture. Soil and plant samples were collected at three, five, seven and nine weeks
after broadcasting. Results revealed that plants receiving UN had a higher shoot dry
weight, shoot N concentration, and shoot N content compared to other treatments. After
the nine weeks of growth the NUE of UN, UM were 9.3%, 9.1% respectively while that
of U was 7.8% at the latter part of vegetative stage. Soil N concentration was similar
among treatments in most of the tested time points. In the pot experiment, plants in the
control treatment had higher root DW than most of the other treatments at third week
after seeding, while the root lengths and root diameters were similar among other
treatments. Use of soil amendments, particularly neem seed cake shows promise in
improving growth and nitrogen nutrition of Bg 300 rice variety.

Use efficiency of N fertilizers (NUE) in vegetable cultivation is very low. Effectiveness
of organic fertilizers made using rice husk biochar to increase the NUE was evaluated.
Fish tonic and cattle slurry were impregnated into rice husk biochar separately and
pelletized together with K-Humate to produce two N enriched organic fertilizers (BOFFT
and BOFCS, respectively). Their effectiveness on improving growth, N uptake and NUE
of Capsicum (Capsicum annum) grown in an Entisol (Reddish Brown Latosols) were
compared against urea only, urea enriched rice husk biochar (SRFU) and no N control
treatments under greenhouse condition. Rates of N applied to all treatments, except the
control treatment, were 106 mg N /kg soil and was based on the recommended level.
Total N content of BOFCS and BOFFT were 1.1% and 2%, respectively while that of SRFU
were 23%. Application of SRFU significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved the greenness (2-7%)
and the plant growth (60%) when compared with the currently practiced urea only
treatment. Application of BOFFT significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved the greenness and the
plant growth when compared with no N control and were not different from those of
SRFU. Apparent recovery of N and agronomic efficiencies were significantly (P&lt;0.05)
improved by SRFU (73% and 15 kg/kg, respectively) and BOFFT (38.8% and 7.8 kg/kg,
respectively) when compared with the urea only treatment (35.7% and 6.59 kg/kg,
respectively). Organic fertilizer made using cattle slurry (BOFCS) did not improve any
parameter measured and was comparable to the control treatment. Poor performance of
the two novel organic fertilizers when compared to SRFU could be due to the very slower
release of organic N during the growing period that could not synchronize with the plant
demand. However, BOFFT has a better potential to be used as an organic N fertilizer than
BOFCS with further modifications.

biochar under two water management regimes. An incubation soil experiment was
conducted as a two-factor factorial experiment in a complete randomized design with 3
replicates for a period of one month. Treatments comprised of application of Triple Super
Phosphate (TSP) to the recommendation of the Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka for
rice crop, Rock Phosphate (RP) as the same rate of P2O5 of TSP application, 5% rice husk
biochar application as per the dry weight of soil and unamended control soil. All
treatments were evaluated under two water management regimes, continuous flooding
(2-cm water level above the soil) and alternate wetting and drying (2-cm overlying water
for one-week, removed and kept drying during succeeding week). After one month, soils
were sampled and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, available P, Potassium (K),
total Nitrogen (N), and bioavailable concentrations of Aluminium (Al), Iron (Fe), Zinc
(Zn), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu) and Cobalt (Co). Biochar addition significantly
(P&lt;0.05) increased soil pH, K, and Mn concentrations in soil and there was no significant
influence on the availability of other metals in ASS. Across both water management
regimes, Al concentration of soil amended with biochar was reduced by 64% and 49%
respectively compared to those of soils amended with TSP and RP. The results indicate
the potential of amending ASS with biochar to increase pH and alleviate Al toxicity
which should be further confirmed by a long-term experiment in the field.

The quality and productivity of floriculture plants highly depend on the surrounding
environmental conditions. Greenhouses can provide suitable microclimatic conditions for
floriculture plants. “Internet of Things (IoT)” is a next-generation automated system that
is used in greenhouse agriculture. Monitoring, data collection, and output generation are
done through this system. This experiment was carried out to study how the use of IoT-
based greenhouses affects the performance of floriculture plants. Codiaeum variegatum
“Croton”, Torenia fournieri “Torenia blue river”, and Euphorbia hypericifolia “Diamond
frost” plants were used in this experiment. IoT-based fully intensive greenhouse, a
Glasshouse with the timer-based system, and a naturally ventilated greenhouse were used
as treatments. Plants were arranged according to a Completely Randomized Design in
the greenhouses. Plant dry weight, leaf area, plant height, and root length were measured
as growth measurements, and chlorophyll content, leaf color, and chlorophyll
fluorescence were also measured as quality and physiological measurements. There were
significant differences among treatments for some measurements. In all three species,
especially, the leaf area and root growth were found to be better in IoT-based
greenhouses. Chlorophyll fluorescence data were collected at 9 am, 12 noon, and 3 pm
on bright sunny days. Fluorescence transient (OJIP) curves that were generated according
to those data also show a significant difference among treatments. The IoT-based
greenhouse environment keeps photosynthesis of croton leaves at a higher level than the
other two greenhouses. The plants in the glasshouse displayed photo-inhibition at noon.
Torenia plants showed a more sensitive relationship with IoT treatment because Torenia
keeps photosynthetic performance relatively constant throughout the day in the IoT-
based Greenhouse. With these results, it can be concluded that, there is a positive impact
of IoT system-based applications on the performance of tested floriculture plant species.

Varieties

Phosphorus (P)-deficiency in soil is one of the major problems in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
cultivation. Modern improved high-yielding rice varieties are highly responsive to P and
rely on high input of P fertilizer. Genetic variation is responsible for the differences in
tolerance to P-deficiency. The gene, PSTOL1 is known to improve P-deficiency tolerance
in rice, particularly in upland conditions. It has been found that some of the Sri Lankan
rice varieties carry the PSTOL1 gene. However, the effect of PSTOL1 gene on improving
P nutrition of Sri Lankan rice varieties with (+) and without (−) PSTOL1 background
under lowland conditions is not known. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine
the P nutrition of selected PSTOL1 (+) and (−) Sri Lankan rice varieties to take-up and
use P under low-P soil conditions. Study included eight local (Bg94-1, Bg300, Bg304,
Bg358, At402, Bw400, Bg450 and Bw272-6B) and two international standard varieties
(Kasalath and Nipponbare with PSTOL1 (+) and (−) backgrounds, respectively). Results
revealed similar P-use efficiency and root diameter among the varieties at low-P
condition. Shoot P content, shoot dry weight, photosynthetic rate, and total root length of
the plants were higher in PSTOL1 (+) varieties (Bg94-1, Bg300, Kasalath, Bg304) and
PSTOL1 (−) rice varieties (Bw400 and Bw272-6B) at low-P condition. Moreover, when
comparing varieties, Bg94-1, Bg300 and Bw400 well performed at low-P condition. The
results conclude that the PSTOL1 gene may not be a major contributor to take up and/or
use P efficiently at low-P lowland soil conditions of tested Sri Lankan rice varieties.

Phytoavailability of lead (Pb) could be high in acidic soils and it can cause significant Pb
transfer to humans, especially via root crops. Accumulation of Pb is dissimilar among
different varieties. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of incorporation of
poultry manure, cattle manure, municipal solid waste compost, and lime on
phytoavailability of Pb in soil for two radish (Raphanus sativus) varieties (i.e., Beeralu
and Japan ball). A field experiment was conducted in an agricultural field located within
a residential area in HawaEliya. The total Pb concentration in soil was 98-297 mg kg 1
and soil pH was 6.25. Organic amendments and lime were added at the rate of 2 kgm-2
and 0.75 kgm-2 respectively. Plants were harvested 56 days after seeding. The Pb
concentrations in peeled-roots, peels and leaves were analyzed. None of the amendments
significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced the Pb accumulation in roots or leaves. Lime showed the
highest potential to reduce the phytoavailability of Pb for radish. It was less than 10-15%
reduction compared to control. The Beeralu variety had a higher Pb concentration in the
peeled-root and leaves compared to that in Japan Ball variety. The Pb concentration in
the peels was lower in the Beeralu variety compared to the Japan Ball variety. The
maximum daily Pb intake was 1.4 times higher than what is allowed by the CODEX safe
limits when consuming the peeled-roots of the Beeralu variety. Consumption of Radish
Leaves of both varieties and peeled-roots of Japan ball variety did not exceed the CODEX
safety limit of Pb intake. Reduction of soil acidity and selection of variety with low Pb
accumulation can reduce the phytoavailability of Pb in contaminated acidic soils.

Litterfall and subsequent decomposition is a fundamental process underlying the input of
nutrients to the soil in terrestrial ecosystems. The aim of this study was to investigate the
litterfall and its potential nutrient return to soil in three agroforestry systems;
homegardens, gliricidia-coffee mixed and teak monoculture plantations. The study was
conducted at the University of Peradeniya Experimental Station at Dodangolla during a
four-month period from September-December 2022. Litters were collected into 2m×2m
litter traps established from 1m above the ground level in each agroforestry system. Initial
soil samples were collected from 1m distance away from the downside of litter trap at
two soil depths (0-15 cm and 15-30 cm). An ingrowth core (15 cm diameter and 30 cm
depth) was established at 1m distance from the litter trap. Amount of litterfall, Nitrogen
(N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents of the litter, and N, P, and K contents
of soil collected from two soil depths, and root growth into the ingrowth core were
measured. There were no significant difference of soil nutrients in two soil depths except
increased P contents in the homegarden at 0-15 cm depth compared to the gliricidia-
coffee and teak plantations. The highest total litterfall was recorded in teak plantation
followed by homegardens and gliricidia-coffee mixed plantation. The greatest root
growth into ingrowth core was observed in gliricidia plantation whereas homegarden
showed the lowest. Gliricidia-coffee plantation produced litters with the highest N
content and return of N through litterfall was also the highest, while homegarden and teak
plantation had the highest K and P return respectively. Species composition and the
temporal variation of litterfall in different agroforestry systems could determine the type
and the amount of nutrient return to the soil through litterfall.

The most common lesions observed in commercial broiler farms are footpad dermatitis
and hock burns, defined as necrotic lesions on the plantar surface of the footpads and in
the hock of growing broiler chicken which compromises welfare. However, there are no
studies done on the prevalence of footpad dermatitis and hock burns in broiler chickens
in Sri Lanka. This study aimed at identifying the prevalence of footpad dermatitis and
hock burns and the relationship between footpad dermatitis and hock burns in broiler
chickens reared under three different housing conditions. Overall, 32-38 days old 1680
broiler chickens from three different commercial broiler housing systems were observed
(Closed house: n=400, Open-sided house: n=320, Buy-back system: n=960). The plantar
surface of the footpads and the hocks of the broiler chickens were macroscopically scored
by using 0-3 and 0-2 scale systems respectively observing right and left foot separately.
The litter quality of all three systems was also observed. Data were analyzed using
Wilcoxon Signed Rank, Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman’s correlation tests. According to
the results, there was no difference(P>0.05) between the severity of footpad dermatitis
and hock burns in the left and right feet in chickens in the three rearing systems. The
prevalence of footpad dermatitis and hock burns were high in the buy-back system and
low in the closed-house system (P&lt;0.05). Correlation coefficient(r=0.276-0.322)
revealed a moderately positive relationship between the severity of footpad dermatitis
and hock burns within the three rearing systems (P&lt;0.01). There was a difference
(P&lt;0.05) among the litter quality of all three rearing systems where closed-house system
had the best and buy-back system had a poor litter condition. In conclusion, the closed-
house system was better compared with open-sided and buy-back broiler rearing systems
in prevalence of footpad dermatitis, hock burns, and litter quality.

Favorable lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculants are used to enhance forage ensiling. The
present study attempted to produce freeze-dried LAB inoculants from Lactobacillus
plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. oris which were isolated from maize, sorghum and
guinea grass silage, respectively. The LAB isolates were inoculated into skim milk broth
(10 %) and incubated at 37º C. Their growth kinetics were studied. All species exceeded
109 CFU/mL by 24 h and reached 3.92 – 4.11 pH by 72 h. Therefore, skim milk (10 %)
broth was chosen as lyophilization media for making freeze-dried LAB inoculants. The
LAB isolates were inoculated separately into MRS broth, incubated at 37º C for 18 h and
pelleted. The pellets were dissolved in skim milk broth (10 %) and the suspensions were
freeze-dried in vials (LAB inoculant). The ensiling ability of LAB inoculants were
compared by inoculating maize, sorghum and guinea grass forage at 3 inoculation rates
(0, 104 and 106 CFU/g fresh forage) and ensiled them for 14 days. The experiment was
conducted as a complete randomized design. The effect of forage, LAB species and
inoculation rate was significant (P&lt;0.05) on the pH and lactic acid, soluble carbohydrate
and ammonia nitrogen contents of silage at 14 days ripening. All LAB inoculants
recorded high (P&lt;0.05) lactic acid contents in silage at 106 CFU/g inoculation rate. The
pH of both maize and sorghum silage was the lowest (P&lt;0.05) when fresh forage was
inoculated with L. rhamnosus (3.43 and 3.48, respectively) or L. oris (3.41 and 3.45,
respectively) at 106 CFU/g inoculation rate. However, the pH of guinea grass silage was
the lowest (P&lt;0.05) when the fresh forage was inoculated with L. oris (4.87) at 104 CFU/g
inoculation rate. The study confirmed the ability of using the newly produced freeze-
dried LAB inoculants in enhancing the quality of maize, sorghum and guinea grass silage.

Gyrinops walla (Walla patta) is an evergreen non-timber forest tree which produce
agarwood similar to the other species in family Thymelaeaceae. Due to the high economic
value of agarwood products, illegal harvesting of the trees reported highly. The present
study was conducted to find the effect of different concentrations of salicylic acid (SA)
on growth and the chemical composition of G. walla shoot cultures with the objective of
producing fragrance compounds under in-vitro condition. Gyrinops walla shoots were
grown in full strength MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium supplemented with 1 mg/L
of BAP+ 0.1 mg/L of IBA without solidifying agent and the effect of three concentrations
of SA (0, 100, 1000 µmol/L) on growth and product synthesis was investigated. Hexane
and dichloromethane extracts of wood, control and elicited shoots and growth medium
were analyzed for their chemical composition using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC).
Medium supplemented with 1000 µmol of SA showed significantly (p&lt;0.05) slowest
growth (0.0395 and 0.041 g per day in dry and fresh weight basis) and highest cell
doubling time (16.11 and 17.54 days in fresh and dry weight basis) compared to the
control (0.0507 g per day and 12 days of growth rate and cell doubling time respectively).
TLC results revealed that the synthesis of chemical constituents is higher in elicited
shoots compared to non-elicited shoots while 1000 µmol concentration of SA released
higher amounts of chemicals into growth medium compared to other two treatment.
Therefore present study show the possibility of producing fragrance compounds from
shoot cultures of G. walla under in-vitro condition.

Productive and reproductive performances of dairy cattle are crucial in profit
maximization of dairy operations. Crossbred dairy cattle herd in National Livestock
Development Board (NLDB) farm in Melsiripura was evaluated to determine the effect
of their genotype on growth, productive and reproductive performances. Records of 44
crossbred cows (Jersey x Sahiwal (JxS), Jersey x Friesian (JxF), and Jersey x Australian
Friesian Sahiwal (JxAFS) crosses), and weight records of 17 Girolando crossbred calves
and 23 other crossbred calves were included in the study. The parameters assessed for
the study were milk yield (MY), lactation length (LL), standardized (305 days) milk yield
(SMY), daily milk yield (DMY), age at first calving (AFC), number of inseminations per
conception (NIC), calving interval (CI), dry period (DP), and calf birth weight (CBW).
The daily weight gain (DWG) and growth rate (GR) of Girolando crossbred calves were
evaluated separately. General Linear Model and Duncan's New Multiple Range Tests
were employed for data analyses and comparison. There was no significant effect of cow
genotype on MY, LL, SMY, DMY, AFC, NIC and CBW (P>0.05). JxAFS cross had
significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower DP (71.59±41.14 days) than all the other crosses, and lower
CI (13.84±2.09 months) than JxS cross (20.25±5.38 days). Moreover, crossbred calves
of Girolando x (JxF) cross, reported significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower DWG (0.29±0.02
kg/day) than the other Girolando crossbred calves. There was a significant (P&lt;0.05)
effect of calf genotype of Girolando crossbreds on GR. Furthermore, calves of Girolando
x (JxF) cross reported low mean GR (13.62 kg/month) compared to other Girolando
crossbred calves. It was concluded that there was a significant effect of the type of
crossbred on reproductive performance of cows. The best growth performance was
shown by Girolando x (JxAFS) and Girolando x (JxS) crossbred calves.

Recent research on pepper is mostly focused on improving agronomic management and
productivity, however, less attention is given for understanding the underlying
physiological basis of dry matter production. Since photosynthesis plays a key role in
determining how much dry matter is produced by plants, quantification of CO2 (A-Ci)
and light (A-I) response curve parameters is a better way to understand photosynthesis
and dry matter production. Thus, this study focused on two currently popular black
pepper varieties (Dingirala and Panniyur-1) that were ready for field planting, with the
objective of determining varietal variation in photosynthetic light and CO2 response
parameters. The pepper plants were arranged according to a Completely Randomized
Design (CRD) then the A-Ci and A-I curve data collected were fitted to an asymptotic
exponential model by non-linear regression using R software. According to the results,
no significant (P=0.05) difference was found between Dingirala and Panniyur-1 related
to light response curve parameters (LSP, Pmax, AQY, RD/Ag) except for the light
compensation point (LCP) and leaf dark respiration (RD) (P&lt;0.05). Further, no significant
(P=0.05) difference was found between Dingirala and Panniyur-1 related to CO2 response
curve parameters (Vcmax, Jmax, Vcmax/Jmax, CCP, RL). According to the overall results, both
Dingirala and Panniyur-1 nursery plants performed equally in relation to photosynthesis
when both varieties are ready for field planting. Furthermore, after field establishment,
physiological trait exploration is recommended to investigate potential varietal variation
at the field level.

Sri Lanka has a wide range of coconut varieties that perform differently. The performance
of these varieties under different environmental conditions is usually evaluated based on
visual scoring or yield data, which takes longer to generate information and also to make
selection decisions. Alternatively, physiological traits like carbon assimilation can be
used to understand how plants respond to different environmental conditions.
Photosynthesis is a key physiological trait that determines carbon assimilation and can
thus be used to better understand plant functioning by quantifying photosynthesis light
response parameters. Potted four varieties of coconut seedlings (TT (Tall x Tall), DGT
(Dwarf Green x Tall), DBT (Dwarf Brown x Tall), and TDB (Tall x Dwarf Brown)) were
arranged in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) to investigate varietal
variation in photosynthetic light response characteristics under field capacity. The means
of Light-saturated photosynthesis rate (Pmax) for TT, DGT, DBT and TDB varieties were
17.50, 17.03, 13.37 and 14.93 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 while the mean Light Compensation
Point (LCP) were 17.92, 15.8, 15.6 and 15.81 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 respectively. Further, the
mean Light Saturation Point (LSP) for TT, DGT, DBT and TDB varieties were 630.2,
570.2, 454.8, and 417.3 µmol photons m-2 s-1 while the mean leaf Dark Respiration rate
(RD) of TT, DGT, DBT and TDB varieties were 0.78, 0.68, 0.66 and 0.81 µmol CO2 m-2
s-1 respectively. However, none of the light response curve parameters and concentrations
of leaf sugar, starch, nitrogen, and phosphorous, growth measurements, and soil nitrogen
and phosphorous varied significantly (P=0.05) among the four varieties tested. Hence, it
can be concluded that the four varieties perform similarly in relation to the above
parameters at the field planting stage. Further research under soil moisture stress
conditions is recommended to identify varietal variation among the same coconut
varieties.

Department of Soil Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Farmers have abandoned the crop-growing lands because of significantly low crop
productivity due to soil contamination with toxic trace elements (PTEs) by the
wastewater disposal of the brass industry in Pilimathalawa. A preliminary assessment of
soil and water was done to assess the basic soil properties and the level of contamination.
The soil pH was acidic (6.00±0.4) and highly contaminated with PTEs. The concentration
of Cu was 12,548±1,280 mg/kg, Zn was 3,993±1,395 mg/kg, Cd was 0.72±0.46 mg/kg,
and Pb was 392±280 mg/kg. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of
incorporating lime in reclaiming and increasing the crop productivity of the land. A field
study was conducted with lime incorporated and control treatments in randomized
complete block design with four blocks. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were grown in the
plots. Bean pods were produced only in lime-added treatments and were analyzed for the
concentration of PTEs. Ludwigia peruviana plant (Diya Milla) was analyzed for trace
elements to assess its’ use in phytoremediation. Liming increased soil pH (8.48 ±0.33)
significantly (P&lt;0.05). All the growth parameters of bean plants are significantly higher
(P&lt;0.05) in lime-added treatment than control. The intake of Cu, Zn, and Cd via
consumption of beans was lower than what is allowed by the CODEX safe limits. The
Pb intake by consumption of beans was similar to the CODEX safe limits indicating
potential health hazards. Ludwigia peruviana has the potential to be used in
phytoremediation of Cu, Zn, and Cd, but not Pb in the considered contaminated soil.
Liming showed potential to increase crop productivity, but many crop types should be
assessed for PTEs concentrations to assess the health risk of consuming the crops
growing in the considered contaminated soil.

The influence of harvesting interval on regrowth, yield and nutritive value of Pakchong-
1 (Pennisetum purpureum cross), Red Napier (Pennisetum purpureum cross) and
Koronivia grass (Brachiaria humidicola) in low country, dry zone was studied. The
experimental design was complete randomized design with three replicates. The forage
plots (25 m2) were randomly selected from the forage fields at the Ridiyagama Farm of
National Livestock Development Board. An equalization cut was made for selected
forage plots at the beginning of Maha season. Plots were manually weeded, and urea
fertilizer was applied at 150 kg/ha and 100 kg/ha for Napier and Brachiaria cultivars,
respectively. Plant growth of the forage were weekly measured until 8 weeks from the
equalization cut and they were harvested at 6 and 8 weeks. The nutritive value and yield
were estimated. The height, leaves number and basal node diameter of the forage were
increased (p&lt;0.05) during the growth period. However, Pakchong-1 and Red Napier
reached the maximum (p&lt;0.05) number of shoots by 3 and 4 weeks, respectively. The
dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent
fiber (ADF) contents of the forages were greater (p&lt;0.05) at 8 weeks. Contrarily, the
crude protein, ash, OM digestibility and metabolizable energy (ME) levels were lower
(p&lt;0.05) at 8 weeks. As a result, the fresh matter, DM, digestible OM and ME yields
were greater when the forage was harvested at 8 weeks. As expected, the DM and OM
yields of Red Napier (9.45 and 7.97 MT/ha) and Pakchong-1 (9.20 and 7.69 MT/ha) were
greater (p&lt;0.05) than Koronivia grass at 8 weeks. Red Napier recorded the highest
(p&lt;0.05) digestible OM (4.34 MT/ha) and ME (75.12 GJ/ha) at 8 weeks. The study
recommends to cultivate Red Napier and Pakchong-1 cultivars and harvest at 8 weeks in
the low country, dry zone.

Fertility of lowland paddy soils is affected by the agroclimatic conditions and agronomic
management practices adopted. It is important to know this variation among
administrative demarcations for effective decision making. Therefore, the variation of
soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), macro, and microelement concentrations among
different administrative demarcations (i.e., districts and provinces) was studied. A total
of 1024 paddy soil samples across the country were collected using a stratified random
sampling approach. Soil available element concentrations (extracted in 0.01 M CaCl2)
were measured using an Inductive Couple Plasma Mass Spectrophotometer, and soil pH
and EC were measured using the 1:5 soil: water extraction method. Soil pH of the samples
had a mean value of 5.26. Jaffna had the highest pH (6.49) while Galle (4.13) had the
lowest. Electrical conductivity had a mean value of 0.18 dS/m. Jaffna had the highest
(0.65 dS/m) while Kegalle (0.04 dS/m) had the lowest EC. Mannar had the highest Mg
(399 mg/kg) and K (116.2 mg/kg) concentrations. Kalutara had the lowest Mg (27.4
mg/kg), and Colombo had the lowest K (25.5 mg/kg) concentrations. Jaffna had lower
concentrations of Zn and Mn while Gampaha had higher Zn, and Trincomalee had higher
Mn. Rathnapura had higher Mo. Matale had lower Fe, while the highest Fe concentration
was observed in Colombo. Soil pH, Na, Mg, K, Fe, and Mo had a (+) relationship with
EC while Al, Co, Zn, and Cd had a (−) relationship. This information would be useful in
the sustainable nutrient management of paddy soils in Sri Lanka.

Repeated measurements are often co-related. This co-relation should be taken to account
when analyzing such data. Moreover, time cannot be a study factor since time cannot be
randomized. Time effect can be studied only by repeated measures analysis. Similarly,
precision can be increased. This study was conducted to evaluate the repeatability of the
seasonal pattern of yield components during 2013 to 2020 in inter-mediate zoon in Sri
Lanka. Wellawa, Malsiripura, and Muruthange estates were used to collect data. Number
of bunches, number of female flowers per bunch, percentage setting, and immature nut
fall data for each season were recorded for the 8 consecutive years. These repeated
measurements were thus used for evaluations. Two-month period was considered as a
season as the most common harvesting method of coconut is the bimonthly harvesting.
According to the results, the year effect of repeatability on the number of bunches is
significant (P&lt;0.05). In addition, season effect and the interaction effect of season and
year were significant (P&lt;0.05). When consider the female flowers per bunch too, year
effect, season effect and interaction effect of season and year were present (P&lt;0.05).
However, with respect to nut setting percentage, the year effect was significant (P&lt;0.05)
but the seasons effect (P>0.05) as well the interaction effect of season and year (p>0.05)
were not significantly different. When consider the immature nut falling per bunches, the
year effect, seasons affect, and the interaction effect of season and year were significant
(p&lt;0.05). Accordingly, it is clear that, not only characteristics have been changed with
time, but also the season effect has also changed with time.

Nitrogen (N) is an essential but limiting plant nutrient. Optimal N supply with crop
demand is a crucial factor. Water availability affected by climate change threatens rice
production. Rice plant’s ability to withstand drought by maintaining optimum
functioning is a combined effect of drought tolerance at its growth stages. Recent policy
changes and economic crisis has led farmers to limit N fertilizer. The objective of this
study was to determine whether susceptibility to drought is greater when rice is grown
under sub-optimal nitrogen. The experiment was employed at the plant house of the
Department of Crop Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya. The
treatment structure was a three-factor factorial (two varieties × three water regimes × two
N regimes) in a randomized complete block design. Three water regimes were well-
watered, water-stressed at vegetative and reproductive stages. A standard variety (Bg250)
and a drought-tolerant variety (Bg251) were used. Drought reduced grain yield at both
100%N and 50%N in both varieties, with stress at reproductive stage causing a greater
reduction (29-66%) than at vegetative stage (15-45%). Yield reductions were lower at
50%N (17-38%) than at 100% (15-66%) and in the tolerant variety (15-46%) than in the
standard variety (29-66%). Yield following vegetative stage drought was greater at
100%N than at 50%N. Yield following reproductive stage drought was greater (Bg250)
at 50%N than at 100%N or similar (Bg251). After water stress at vegetative stage,
nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), defined as the amount of biomass per unit N uptake, was
greater under water stress than under well-watered conditions, at 50%N than at 100%N
and in Bg251 than in Bg250. After water stress at reproductive stage, NUE did not differ
between water or N regimes or varieties. It is concluded that susceptibility to drought in
rice is greater at 100%N than at 50%N.

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), which belongs to the family Solanaceae, is a widely
grown and consumed vegetable in Sri Lanka. Stomatal anatomy is an important leaf
characteristic for exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapour between plant leaves and
its environment. Stomata can impact the leaf function, with changes in density and size
affecting potential water loss, CO2 uptake, and leaf temperature. The objective of this
study was to determine the interactive effects of water deficits, and sub-optimal water
and nitrogen supply on the stomatal anatomy of tomato (variety Thilina) in different
growing environments. Experiments were carried out in the temperature-controlled
greenhouse, Uncontrolled greenhouse, and open field environment at the Agricultural
Biotechnology Center in Meewathura from September to November 2022. Treatments
were laid out in Randomized Complete Block Designs (RCBD) with five blocks in three
different environments separately. Three leaflets of the fifth leaf from the top of each of
the five plants in each treatment were collected. A stomatal impression was taken and the
slide was prepared, and images were taken using a light microscope mounted with a
digital camera. Anatomical measurement was made with these images using Image J
software. Stomatal density, epidermal cell density, stomatal index, stomatal size, and
potential conductance index were taken as anatomical measurements. Abaxial and
adaxial stomatal density, adaxial stomatal index, adaxial stomatal size, and adaxial
potential conductance index were not significantly different among different water or
nutrient regimes (p>0.05). Sub-optimal water and nitrogen supply significantly affected
epidermal cell density, abaxial stomatal size, abaxial stomatal index, and abaxial potential
conductance index (p&lt;0.05). However, these differences were not consistent across the
three growing environments. It is concluded that stomatal anatomy of tomato has a
limited sensitivity to variation in water and nitrogen supply while being under strong
genetic control.

Plants have several adaptations to survive in nutrient-deficient habitats. Grevillea robusta
which belongs to family Proteacea forms specialized root structures known as “cluster
roots” as an adaptive response to P-deficiency. This study was aimed to investigate root
growth changes, nutrient uptake and nutrient use efficiency of G. robusta grown in N and
P-limited conditions during a three-month period. A hydroponic pot experiment was
conducted with four different nutrient media conditions; nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
sufficient, P-deficient, N-deficient, and (N+P)-deficient in a glasshouse. In nutrient-
sufficient medium, all nutrients were supplied in required amounts. In nutrient-deficient
medium, N and P concentrations were maintained at 0.25 ppm. The impact of N- or P-
deficiency and their co-limitation on cluster root formation, dry weight of different plant
organs, N, P, and potassium (K) uptake and use efficiencies were measured. Grevillea
robusta did not develop cluster roots when it was grown with sufficient nutrient levels.
Highest number of cluster roots were formed in P-deficient condition. Although, cluster
roots were formed under N- and (N+P)-deficient conditions, it was comparatively lower
than that of P-deficient conditions suggesting that P-deficiency is the principle parameter
determining cluster root formation of G. robusta. There was a tendency to increase the
total plant dry weight when cluster roots are present and growth of G. robusta was not
reduced in the P-deficient treatment. The greatest reduction of plant dry weight was
observed under (N+P)-deficient condition. Although the uptake of particular nutrient
reduced when the growing solution is nutrient-deficient, use efficiency of the relevant
nutrient in biomass formation was significantly (P&lt;0.05) enhanced. P-remobilization
efficiency was greatly increased both under N- and (N+P)-deficiency indicating the
efficient use of acquired P under these nutrient-deficient conditions.

Drought is a major abiotic stress that affects all stages of plant growth and development
of paddy resulting in large yield reductions, especially in rainfed cultivation. Around 35%
of farmers give up cultivation in the Yala season especially due to water scarcity.
Developing drought-tolerant rice varieties has thus, become essential. DEEPER
ROOTING 1 (DRO 1) is a Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) responsible for deep rooting
that helps paddy plant to tolerate drought stress. This research was conducted to study
the root morphology in several selected paddy varieties under drought and to develop a
molecular marker for screening of DRO 1 gene in paddy varieties. Seven varieties (local
and exotic) selected from previous studies were used in both pot and field experiments.
Drought stress was imposed on paddy plants in the pot experiment from 21 days after
planting (DAP). Roots with a root angle from 0 to 45° were considered as shallow roots
and those with 45-90° as deep roots. For molecular screening, a DNA primer was
designed using 1bp deletion of the reference gene of IR64. The designed primer and leaf
DNA were used for PCR analysis and the products were separated using 2% Agarose gel.
Morphological screening revealed that the percentage of deep roots in Bg 300 and BRRI
Dhan 71 were higher (p&lt;0.05) than the other varieties. Deep and shallow rooting was
similar (p>0.05) in IRDTN 7-56 and AR 9-3. Dry weight of deep roots were higher than
the shallow roots (p&lt;0.05) in Bg 314 (drought-tolerant variety) and Bg 352. Further, the
dry weight of deep roots in those two varieties were higher (p&lt;0.05) than the other
varieties. The newly designed primer was able to provide the desired PCR product, and
it is recommended to be used in DNA sequencing to confirm the presence of DRO 1.

Department of Agricultural Biology,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
The present study was focused on the screening of plant growth promotion and pathogen
suppression abilities of 10 isolates of actinomycetes isolated from the rice rhizosphere.
Phosphorus solubilizing and nitrogen-fixing abilities were assayed in vitro on selective
media. Colony growth inhibition of rice pathogens, namely Rhizoctonia solani and
Bipolaris oryzae by the actinomycetes was tested by dual culture plate technique on
casein starch medium. Nine and one isolates/isolate respectively, demonstrated moderate
and low nitrogen-fixing ability on Ashby’s Mannitol agar medium. Nine isolates gave
phosphorus solubilization indices ranging from 1.3 – 4. 05 on NBRIP medium. Colony
growth of the two pathogens was inhibited (15-71%) by nine isolates. After confirming
the compatibility, a consortium was prepared using all the isolates, each having a cell
concentration of 1 x 106 cfu/mL. Growth promotion ability of the consortium was
evaluated using rice seedlings (var. Bg 360) providing three basal fertilizer levels, namely
recommended nitrogen (T1), ½ recommended nitrogen + actinomycete consortium (T2)
and actinomycete consortium only (T3). Controls were maintained with no nitrogen
fertilizer or actinomycete consortium. Plant height, root and shoot dry weights, number
of leaves/seedlings and leaf area were significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in the three
treatments than the control. Seedlings treated with T3 reported the highest root dry
weight. Plant height, shoot dry weight and leaf area values were significantly higher in
T1 (P&lt;0.05). The second-highest shoot dry weight and leaf area values were reported by
seedlings in T2 and were significantly higher than those in T3 (P&lt;0.05). No. of leaves
had no significant difference among the three treatments and the control. The tested
actinomycetes, as a consortium, can be integrated as a promising biological input in rice
cultivation for growth promotion, especially the root growth and suppression of the tested
fungal pathogens.

Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) is a multipurpose tree and one of the most
common tree species in Sri Lanka that plays an important role in livelihood of rural and
urban people of the country. Even though there are vast numbers of benefits, Jackfruit is
still considered as an underutilized fruit species in Sri Lanka, mainly due to unavailability
of quality planting materials in the county. This experiment was conducted to evaluate
jackfruit local genotypes, with respect to their morphological and physiological
characters. One hundred Jackfruit trees were selected in Dehideniya (G.N. Division 284)
area in Kandy district. These genotypes were evaluated using “(IPGRI) 2000 -
Descriptors for Jackfruit”. Tree characters and fruit characters such as variety, age,
height, diameter at breast height, first flowering, fruit bearing pattern and position,
number of fruits per tree, fruit clustering habit, leaf blade shape, flesh type, stalk
attachment, fruit shape, fruit diameter, fruit length, weight of the fruit, skin (rind) color
and texture, number of flakes in the fruit, weight of flakes, shape of flake, color of flake,
taste, amount of latex, time of latex flow and uses of fruits (suitability as fresh fruit, as
staple food or as polos curry or mallum) were evaluated under the experiment. Results
were analyzed pair wise, using Chi-square test in order to find an association between
characters to develop the morphological index. Amount of latex, time of latex flow, taste,
color of flakes indicated an association (at p&lt;0.05 significant level) with its relevant
variable and those characters were used to develop the morphological index.

Epipremnum aureum ‘Marble Queen’ is a widely used foliage plant for interiorscape
purposes (hanging baskets, dish gardens, and totems). It has high demand in the
floriculture industry and is propagated commercially using single nodal cuttings. In
floriculture industry, they are exported as rooted and unrooted cuttings. Rooting medium
has a decisive influence on rooting of cuttings. This experiment was conducted to
optimize the rooting of 'Marble Queen' cuttings using an appropriate rooting medium and
an optimum concentration of Indole – 3 – Butyric Acid (IBA). Two experiments were
conducted to determine the rooting performance of 'Marble Queen' cuttings under the
production of rooted cuttings and unrooted cuttings for the export market. In experiment
one, the effect of rooting media and IBA was evaluated to produce rooted cuttings. In
experiment two, the rooting performances of unrooted cuttings after an export simulation
(48-hour cold storage at 21°C) were tested. Two different rooting media (coir dust and
oasis) and four different concentrations of IBA (0 mg·L-1, 250 mg·L-1, 500 mg·L-1, and
1000 mg·L-1) were tested. Rooting media showed the most significant effects on rooting
of 'Marble Queen' cuttings. Coir dust medium reported highest number of roots per
cutting, roots-to-shoot ratio, and average root diameter. Minimum days to bud and root
initiation and a higher number of leaf buds were observed in oasis medium. Early rooting
and a higher number of roots were observed with the application of 500 mg·L-1 IBA. The
use of appropriate rooting media and optimum concentration of IBA would help in the
rapid propagation of 'Marble Queen' cuttings. Application of 500 mg·L-1 IBA in the oasis
medium was more efficient in early rooting and shoot growth of 'Marble Queen' cuttings.
Coir dust medium along with 500 mg·L-1 IBA was most suitable for the efficient growth
and development of 'Marble Queen' cuttings.

Is Biochar a Panacea for Sustainable Soil Fertility Management? : A
Systematic Evaluation of Compost and Biochar Amended Soils

Department of Soil Science,

Although short-term impacts of biochar application on soil fertility have been studied
extensively, information on their medium- and long-term effects are meager. Hence, it is
premature to conclude that biochar application is a sustainable soil fertility management
technology. This study was carried out to evaluate medium-term impact of biochar
application on soil fertility in a corn growing Alfisol using a systematic approach which
integrate nutrient availability, fixation of nutrients and plant growth. Soil (Typic
Rhodustalfs) was collected from an ongoing field experiment after three years of its
establishment. Four treatments: NPK fertilizers only (CF), single application of 17 Mg
of Rice husk biochar (RHBC) or Corncob biochar (CCBC) per hectare with CF, and
repeated application of 10 Mg of compost per hectare with CF, were selected for this
study. Except Cu and Mg, the availability of P, K, S, and Zn were less than the optimum
levels in all treatments. Available Cu contents were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in
RHBC amended treatment. Fixation study revealed that the amount of P added to achieve
the optimum levels in CCBC+CF treated soils were high (62 mg/kg) although not
statistically different (P>0.05) from other treatments (38-46 mg/kg). Sorghum (Sorghum
bicolor L) plants were grown in small cups using the missing element technique to
evaluate the plant availability of nutrients in different treatments. Nitrogen is the most
limiting nutrient in all treatments while both P and Zn were deficient in CCBC amended
soil. Application of K and S did not significantly increase the plant growth in any
treatment, probably due to their marginal deficiency. We concluded that RHBC and
CCBC are not capable of increasing plant available nutrient contents more than compost
amended or CF applied soils by the end of three years when they are applied at rates used
in this experiment.

Antibiotic resistance has become a global health hazard. Antibiotics are increasingly used
in animal husbandry to treat clinical diseases, prevent infections as well as growth
promoters. However, overuse and misuse of antimicrobials have led to generation of
antibiotic resistant bacteria. Therefore, surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is
important. Cow’s milk contaminated with antimicrobial resistant bacteria is a serious
health issue. In this study, cow’s milk samples from bulk tanks were collected from a
farm in Uda Peradeniya and 2 farmer managed societies including Orayanwatta and
Growhill in the Kandy District. Samples were collected aseptically and screened for the
antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Pure cultures of the antimicrobial resistant bacteria were
obtained through the pour plate method. Streak plate method was followed for isolating
single colonies on nutrient agar containing four antibiotics (amoxicillin,
chloramphenicol, cephalexin and ciprofloxacin). Of the four antibiotics used, all samples
showed antibiotic resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. Milk samples from
Orayanwatta showed the resistance only to chloramphenicol. Ciprofloxacin resistance
was observed in both Orayanwatta and Growhill samples. Morphological observation
along with 3 biochemical tests including Gram stain, spore formation and catalase test
were performed on the isolated colonies. A colony PCR was designed to amplify resistant
genes. These data suggested that Escherichia sp. and Pseudomonas sp. showed
amoxicillin and cephalexin resistance. Both Bacillus sp. and Streptococci sp. showed
ciprofloxacin resistance while Staphylococcus sp. showed chloramphenicol resistance.
Milk samples from Orayanwatta contained β-lactamase resistant bacteria. Results from
the current study suggested the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria to 4
antibiotics in farms in the Kandy District. Further investigation is necessary to
characterize antibacterial resistant bacteria.

Thermal Acclimation Potential of Leaf Photosynthesis of Two Pioneer
Seedling Species to Increase in Average Growth Temperature

Climate change has resulted in higher daily, seasonal, and annual mean temperatures.
Many plants are known to adjust their photosynthetic characteristics by changing the
optimum temperature of photosynthesis (thermal acclimation of photosynthesis) in
response to changes in growth temperature. Degraded lands experience high ambient
temperatures and moisture stress, and hence, it is important to understand the
photosynthetic characteristics of pioneer seedling species used for land restoration, in
response to both increases in growth temperature and soil moisture stress conditions.
Thus, in this study two pioneer seedling species, namely, Macaranga peltata (Kanda)
and Neolitsea cassia (Dawul Kurudu), were established in two thermal environments:
24.46±0.11 °C and 27.97±0.16 °C, at field capacity (FC) and water-stress conditions (WS,
i.e., 50% of the available water). The temperature response of rate of light saturated net
photosynthesis (Asat) was determined at 25-35 °C leaf temperature range. At the FC, both
M. peltata and N. cassia showed a significant increase (P&lt;0.05) in the optimum
temperature (Topt) of photosynthesis from a lower thermal environment to a higher
thermal environment. This demonstrated the thermal acclimation potential of the two
pioneer species to higher average growth temperatures. However, when the average
growth temperature increased in water-stress condition, none of the two pioneer species
showed a significant increase (P>0.05) in Topt. Rates of light-saturated net photosynthesis
(Asat) were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05) from the FC to water-stress conditions in M.
peltata, however, not in N. cassia. Therefore, N. cassia (Dawul Kurudu) can be
considered a better performing pioneer species at high growth temperatures along with
water-stress conditions, when compared to M. peltata (Kanda).

Land degradation is growing into a major problem of the 21st century, causing a number
of social, economic, and environmental issues. Though such lands can be restored using
pioneer species, their physiological traits responsible for acquiring higher net carbon
gains under varying climatic conditions remain poorly studied. Thus, in this study two
pioneer species, Kenda (Macaranga peltate) and Dawul Kurundu (Neolitsesa cassia)
were grown at two average growth temperatures: 24.4±0.9 °C (low growth temperature),
and 27.9±1.2 °C (high growth temperature), under field capacity (FC) and water stress
conditions (50% of the available water), and their leaf respiration and thermal sensitivity
(Q10) of leaf respiration were quantified in the 25–40 °C temperature range. When
measured at a common temperature (25 oC), both species grown at high growth
temperature had significantly lower (P&lt; 0.05) rates of leaf R than the same species grown
at low growth temperature at FC, exhibiting acclimation of leaf respiration to high growth
temperature and reducing carbon loss at high growth temperatures; however, no such
difference was observed under water stress conditions. Further, the thermal sensitivity of
leaf respiration (Q10) decreased with increasing leaf temperature over the measurement
range in both species at both growth temperatures and two soil moisture levels. Moreover,
carbon loss occurs at a slower rate in response to increasing leaf temperature in both
species grown at high growth temperatures, when compared to both species grown at low
growth temperatures. Considering the thermal acclimation potential of leaf respiration,
both species can be successfully used as high potential pioneer species for land
restoration.

This study investigated the effect of cobs remained in the maize crop residues and
different inclusion rates of molasses on the nutritional and sensory quality of maize bale
silage. PAC 984 grain maize variety harvested after approximately 75 days was used in
preparation of silage. Three sets of bale silage were prepared using 25%, 50% and 100%
of cobs remained in the maize crop residues to evaluate the effect of cob percentage.
Molasses was incorporated at 3% and 5% to evaluate the quality in silage. There were 5
treatments, each with 2 replicates. After 40 days of ensiling, samples were collected for
proximate analysis (Dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), crude fiber (F),
organic matter (OM) and pH) and sensory evaluation which was carried out for all the
treatments immediately after silage bales were opened. Data were subjected to one-way
ANOVA and Tukey mean separation test procedures using SPSS software. Cob and
molasses percentage significantly (p&lt;0.05) affected on DM, CP, F, and pH of silage but
not on CF and OM. Silage prepared with 100% cobs showed the highest (P&lt;0.05) DM
(29.45±0.07%), CP (6.68±0.18%), F (32.65±0.15%) and the lowest pH (4.46±0.01)
compared to the other treatments. Silage prepared with 5% of molasses showed the
highest (P&lt;0.05) DM (27.45±0.07%), CP (5.53±0.14%), and the lowest (P&lt;0.05) F
(25.66±0.06%) and pH (4.42±0.01) compared to 3% molasses treatment. The sensory
evaluation (color, odor and texture) identified the silage prepared with 5% of molasses
as the best. This study revealed that silage prepared with residues remaining with 100%
cobs was superior in nutritional composition compared to the silage prepared using
residues without cobs but low in quality in comparison to bale silage produced
commercially using forage maize.

All plants require right amount of light, water, nutrients and space for their growth and
development. Protected culture and hydroponics provide the best solutions for constraints
faced by perishable crops in open-field agriculture. Hydroponics or soilless culture is the
method of growing crops indoor without using soil. Drip fertigated coco-peat bag culture
is the most widely used aggregate type hydroponics system for protected culture of
vegetable crops. However, the availability and cost of imported hydroponic fertilizers
under present economic crisis have imposed limitations on conventional hydroponic
practices in Sri Lanka. Further, the demand for organic vegetables is yet to explore in
local and global markets. Taking these facts into consideration, this research was
conducted to investigate the effects of selected organic fertilizer, bio fertilizer and soil
conditioner combinations for growth and development of vegetable capsicum grown in
phospho-compost medium and coco-peat bag culture under semi-intensive greenhouse
conditions. This research was conducted in semi-intensive greenhouse conditions in the
mid-country Intermediate Zone (IM3). Organic fertilizer treatments were selected based
on the outcome of some previous research. Vermiwash, Jeevamrutham, Biochar, Banana
stem extract and Gliricidia leaf extract were used in appropriate combinations and ratios
(based on their N, P and K levels) as alternative sources of plant nutrients to be compared
with the Albert’s fertilizer (control). Agronomy and plant protection of capsicum were
done following the standard practices. Growth and yield performances of capsicum plants
grown in organic input-based bag culture were significantly higher compared to the
control treatment. There was no significant difference in plant growth and yield among
different organic input treatments. Therefore, each combination of organic inputs tested
in the experiment has shown the potential for replacing inorganic hydroponic fertilizers
in coco-peat bag culture grown vegetables in protected culture.

Guinea grass is one of the most abundant and underutilized fodder varieties in Sri Lanka.
Azolla is an aquatic fern that is high in protein, therefore, has the potential to be
incorporated into grass silages to improve the protein content. This study was conducted
to evaluate the nutritional composition and sensory quality of the silage produced using
different combinations of Azolla and Guinea Grass. Five different silages were prepared
to mix different proportions of Azolla and Guinea Grass: (1) Azolla only (control 1); (2)
Guinea grass only (control 2); (3) 25 % of Azolla ,75 % Guinea grass; (4) 50 % of Azolla,
50 % of Guinea grass; and (5) 75 % of Azolla, 25 % of Guinea grass. Silages were
analyzed for the crude protein (CP%), crude fibre (CF%), ash (%), ether extract (EE%)
and dry matter (DM%). The nutritional composition of all five silages were significantly
different (p&lt;0.05). CP (18.84%), EE (4.78%), ash (17.52%) and pH (5.33) were higher
in the silage produced from 100 % Azolla and these parameters were decreased with the
reducing percentage of Azolla in silages. In contrast, crude fibre and organic matter
contents were lower in silage produced from 100% Azolla and these parameters were
increased with the reduction of Azolla percentage in silage. Color, odor, and texture were
best shown in the silage produced using 50% of Guinea grass and 50% Azolla compared
to the other silages. Combined all the results suggest that the inclusion of 50% Guinea
grass and 50% of Azolla produce the highest quality silage (CP -12.36%, DM – 22.23%,
pH – 4.17) compared with the other combinations. A digestibility trial, however, is
required to decide the potential use of the Azolla and Guinea grass mixed silages in
feeding ruminant animals.

Hardseededness is a major problem in local Mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) verities which
is mainly governed by both genetic and environmental factors. The objective of this study
was to check whether the growing area effects the occurrence of hard seeds in Ari, MI5,
MI6, and MI7 Mung bean varieties. The experiment was conducted as a randomized
complete block design (nested within location) in three replicates in Gannoruwa,
Mahailluppallama and Bataatha post control units, Department of Agriculture, during
early September to late November, 2022. Hard seeds were counted at seven different
soaking times (8h-T1, 12h-T2, 16h-T3, 24h-T4, 48h-T5, 72h-T6 and, 96h-T7) treatments.
Then hard seed percentages (HSP) were calculated. According to the results, MI6 grown
in Gannoruwa showed the highest HSP (78%) while MI5 showed the lowest (10%). In
Bataatha, the variety Ari had highest HSP (40%) and MI6 had the lowest (2%). In
Mahailluppallama, MI6 and MI7 showed highest and lowest HSP respectively as 30%
and 18%. As per the location wise comparison, Gannoruwa showed the highest HSP
compared to other two locations while Mahailluppallma was having the lowest. To check
the hard seed occurrence in consumers’ perspective, seeds grown in Gannoruwa were
boiled after 8h soaking. There, the variety MI6 showed the highest HSP which was
however lower than the HSP at 96h soaking. From the results of this study, it can be
concluded that, the HSP of the same Mung bean variety varies depending on the growing
area as well as, the HSP varies between varieties within a single location. Also, boiling
can reduce the HSP but cannot eliminate.

Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is an annual cash crop widely cultivated over the world.
This study was aimed to investigate the growth, leaf yield and quality characteristics of
tobacco cultivated under different irrigation levels. A Randomized Complete Block
Design with 3 replicates was laid in a farmer field in Galewela, Dambulla. Furrow
irrigation (FI), alternative furrow irrigation (AFI) and bed irrigation (BI) were used as
different irrigation regimes in the study. A popular hybrid variety among farmers, Lk-01
was used for cultivation. Water input under different irrigation regimes were measured
using a water pump and a water meter. Rainfall during the experimental period was also
recorded. Measurements were taken at grand growth stage and leaf maturity stage.
Biomass accumulation of all plant organs, leaf number and area, nitrogen (N),
phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) uptake and use efficiencies, water productivity and
leaf quality parameters were measured. There were no significant variations of measured
parameters among three irrigation levels in grand growth stage. However, at leaf maturity
stage, FI showed the greater biomass accumulation in all plant organs, leaf area and leaf
number, N/P-use efficiencies and water use efficiency (WUE) in biomass formation. The
WUE recorded under FI was 39% higher than that in bed irrigation. FI could also
contribute more to enhance the final product quality than other two irrigation regimes.
For example, leaf chlorine (Cl) content under FI stands closer to recommended level (1%)
compared to AFI and BI. Therefore, adoption of FI could have more yield advantage and
economic benefits for the growers.

Tea is a major cash crop in Sri Lanka. Predicting the potential effects of many changes
on tea crop prompts the user to analyze how the crop responds to many variables. Many
plantation companies and their estates maintain highly accurate records on their crops
and other aspects. However, they do not conduct proper analysis of these records to
understand the yield trends in relation to different variables. Such analysis will allow
estates to take management decisions with high accuracy. The objective of the present
study was to study the yield trends in the Ingestry estate, Hatton to take better
management decisions when conducting field practices. In this regard, the present study
was mainly focused on identifying yield trends in pruning cycle, age of the stand, cultivar
and rainfall using the records maintained at the estate. In this regard yield records
maintained by Ingestre Estate in the Cycle Yield Book, Tea book and Year Budget Book
from 2000-2022 were used for the study. The results of the study revealed that the total
yield of studied tea fields declined with successive pruning cycles. This may be due to
aging of the tea bushes. Yields of different fields were found different despite they were
going through parallel in the pruning cycles. This can be attributed to the differences in
many factors such as soil conditions, cultivar and age. Second and third years of the
pruning cycle produced the highest yields in the VP tea fields whereas OST fields showed
relatively even yield patterns throughout the pruning cycle. April to June and September
to December produced the highest yield during the calendar year. The annual yield
patterns varied among cultivars. A regression analysis showed that relation between tea
yield and rainfall was non-significant. This information can be used for better planning
field practices.

Banana (Musa spp.) is the fourth most consuming food and it provides several nutritional
benefits. Nitrogen is essential for banana plant for the growth and development.
Application of nitrogen fertilizer on the basis of blanket recommendations may cause
over application or under application due to variations in soil properties. Objectives of
this study were to evaluate the potential of using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based
multispectral imagery to predict nitrogen status of banana crop and study relationship
between leaf total nitrogen content and soil properties. Multispectral images were
acquired using an agricultural UAV, preprocessed, mosaicked and soil reflections were
removed by image classification using iso-cluster unsupervised classification.
Multispectral images were used to calculate different vegetative indices and the images
of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used for further analysis. Jenks
natural breaks classification method was used to classify the NDVI values into five
classes. Sample points for leaf and soil sampling were identified randomly representing
five NDVI classes. Then a leaf sample was taken from banana plant at each sampling
locations and SPAD meter reading of the same leaf were recorded at five randomly
selected places. Moreover, surface soil sample (0-30 cm) was taken near to the selected
banana plant, total nitrogen concentration of leaf sample, pH, Electrical conductivity
(EC) and organic matter percentage of soil sample were analyzed. Strong linear
regression relationships were observed between NDVI and SPAD meter reading (R2 =
0.57) and leaf total nitrogen (R2 = 0.79). However, leaf total nitrogen did not show strong
relationship with soil pH (R2 = 0.03), EC (R2 = 0.06), and organic matter content (R2 =
0.25). A strong relationship between NDVI and leaf total N showed multispectral
imagery can be used to predict nitrogen status, thus allowing site-specific N fertilizer
management in banana.

The Effectiveness of a Mixed Culture of Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria for
Improving the Growth of Selected Vegetable Crops Cultivated in two soils
under Plant House Conditions

Use of phosphate solubilizing bacteria based biofertilizer is a sustainable approach to
increase soil P availability for crops. A study was conducted to assess the ability of
phosphate solubilizing bacteria mixed culture inoculum (PSB) to enhance growth of
selected vegetable crops cultivated in two soils under plant-house conditions. Firstly, the
performance of five vegetable crops (tomato, capsicum, brinjal, beet root, and chili)
during the nursery stage was assessed with and without PSB application to nursery
potting media. Significant (P&lt;0.05) increase (27%) in the number of leaves per plant was
observed for brinjal seedlings with PSB application. Chili showed a significant (P&lt;0.05)
increase (23%) in plant height with PSB application. Phosphate solubilizing bacteria
abundance significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) with PSB application in beet root (4.6%),
brinjal (12%) and chili (12%). A second experiment was conducted focusing on crop
performance during the vegetative growth phase of chili cultivated in two soils; i.e. an
Alfisol and an Ultisol with nine treatment combinations related to N, K and P supply.
The treatments were NKP, NK, NK+PSB, NK+75%P, NK+75%P+PSB, NK+Eppawala
Rock Phosphate (ERP), NK+ERP+PSB, PSB only, and no fertilizers. The available P
content of the Ultisol and alfisol soil were different (178 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg,
respectively). Shoot and root biomass of chili was not significantly affected (P >0.05) by
soil type. Nutrient supply from inoculated treatments significantly affected (P &lt;0.05)
plant growth parameters. Dry biomass of plants increased significantly (P &lt;0.05) with
PSB application in Alfisol than in Ultisol. Phosphate solubilizing bacteria abundance
significantly increased (P &lt;0.05) in Alfisol with PSB application (211%). The results
indicated that PSB application increased soil available P in both soils and the response of
vegetable plant growth to PSB application differs between high and low P soils.

Qualitative and quantitative changes in exposed light are major factors affecting the
photosynthetic efficiency of cut foliage. Although the black shade net is recommended
for most ornamental species, the photosynthetic performance under colored shade nets
has not been studied sufficiently for such species. In this study, we attempted to
investigate the effect of color shade nets (black, red, white and blue) on the
photosynthetic performance of Dracaena sanderiana (White variety) and Dracaena
surculosa (Florida Beauty and Japanese bamboo varieties). Chlorophyll fluorescence
data were collected through OJIP analysis using a portable fluorometer (Fluor Pen, FP
100). Leaf chlorophyll contents, root: shoot ratio (dry weight basis), and leaf color were
measured. The light spectrum under the four color nets changed from 318 nm to 885 nm
with contrasting peaks under each net as recorded with a spectroradiometer (Spectrapen
mini, PSI). The performance index (PI) which is derived from the absorption per reaction
center (ABS/RC), maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry (ϕPo), and
electron transport efficiency (ϕEo) was significantly higher in black shade nets compared
to other treatments in D. sanderiana (White variety) and D. surculosa (Gold dust
varieties). There is no significant difference (p>0.05) in the PI of D. surculosa (Florida
beauty) under different nets. A significant difference in leaf colur among the treatments
in all tested species was also not observed. Highest root: shoot ratio was observed in the
plants under red shade nets. We conclude that all the colored shade nets can be
recommended for D. surculosa (Florida beauty) and black shade nets can be
recommended for D. sanderiana (White variety) and D. surculosa Gold dust varieties as
revealed by the chlorophyll fluorescence transient analysis.

The clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats and associated proteins
(CRISPR-Cas) is an adaptive and hereditary immune system which can be found in most
species of Archaea and Bacteria. This system provides the protection for these
prokaryotes from foreign genetic elements such as bacteriophages and plasmids.
CRISPR-Cas system is found in many members of Enterobacteriaceae family. This
study was conducted to analyze the CRISPR-Cas system of selected strains of
Enterobacteriaceae using bioinformatic tools and to design a KNIME, The Konstanz
Information Miner workflow to analyze available CRISPR-Cas data of this family. In
this study, one Enterobacter cloacae strain and three E. hormaechei strains were used.
To detect CRISPR sites in the selected strains CRISPRCasFinder, CRISPROne, CRISPR
Recognition Tool (CRT) and Piler-CR tools were used. CRISPRCasFinder tool detected
CRISPR arrays and their locations in all selected strains and CRISPROne tool detected
Cas genes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems present in these strains. CRISPROne tool
identified these detected CRISPR-Cas systems as belonging to Type I-A and IV-A
systems. Primers for detected CRISPR arrays were designed using the Primer3Plus tool
for future analysis. A workflow was designed using KNIME software to analyze
available CRISPR-Cas data for the family Enterobacteriaceae. Based on the study,
CRISPRCasFinder can be recommended as an accurate bioinformatic tool for the
detection of CRISPR arrays, while CRISPROne tool can be recommended for the
detection of Cas genes. Though type I-E and I-F CRISPR systems are dominant in this
family, the study revealed the possibility of having other types and a diversity among
CRISPR-Cas systems within the family.

Feasibility Assessment of Using CafLess-TCS1 Marker to Identify Low-
caffeine Tea Hybrids

Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is the second most consumed beverage in the
world. Caffeine is a purine alkaloid present in tea with known health benefits. However,
excessive intake causes negative effects such as palpitations, insomnia, and allergies.
Alternatively, low-caffeine tea and decaffeinated tea carry less adverse effects.
Decaffeinated tea produced using mechanical methods are low in quality and have poor
consumer acceptance, leading to reduced market value. Hence, attempts are made to
breed low-caffeine tea cultivars. The current study assessed the feasibility of using the
CafLess-TCS1 marker to identify low-caffeine tea hybrids. Floral assessment was
performed to differentiate 36 backcross progenies (BC1) derived from crosses between
the high-caffeine cultivar, TRI3055 and accessions PBGT41, PBGT48, PBGT49, into
China (15), Cambod (16) and Assam (5) types. Using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s
mean separation, a selection of 20 hybrid progeny and their parents were evaluated for
the caffeine content. Caffeine contents of accession PBGT49, F1 progeny of
TRI3055×PBGT49, and two BC1 progenies each of the crosses F1 of
(TRI3055×PBGT49) × PBGT49, F1 of (TRI3055×PBGT48) × PBGT48 and F1 of
(TRI3055×PBGT41) × PBGT41 were not significantly (P>0.05) different to the high-
caffeine cultivar TRI3055. A PCR fragment of approximately 527 bp was amplified using
the CafLess-TCS1 marker for TRI3055 and selected low-caffeine accessions. The PCR
products were resolved on a 8% polyacrylamide gel stained with silver nitrate. The
resulted marker profile revealed a unique banding pattern for TRI3055, distinctive from
its progeny. However, a clear correlation between the caffeine content and the CafLess-
TCS1 marker could not be derived for the low-caffeine tea accessions used. Hence, it is
recommended to adopt a sequence-based approach to identify the variations in these
accessions at the CafLess-TCS1 marker locus and to see if variations observed are
specific to any tea type or caffeine level.

Co-Pyrolysis of Rice Husk with Nitrogen-Rich Waste to Make Nitrogen
Enrich Biochar

Biochar has a growing demand for soil application as a soil amendment that improves
the soil's physicochemical and biological properties while sequestering carbon.
Conventional biochar is not generally recognized as a potential source of nutrients
because most of the nutrients in feedstock biomasses are lost, volatilized, or leached out
during the thermochemical conversion process. This research aimed at developing a
novel method for manufacturing nitrogen-enriched biochar by pyrolyzing Torrefied Rice
Husk (TRH) with three nitrogen-rich waste biomasses: Fish Waste (FW), Chicken
Feather (CF), and Human Hair (HH). First, 20 kg of rice husk were torrefied to biochar
at 300°C in a double-chamber batch pyrolysis reactor at the Meewatura experimental
station. The waste biomasses were air dried and ground into &lt;0.25 mm particles before
being co-pyrolyzed with torrefied rice husk. Using the muffle furnace, co-pyrolysis was
done in a mini-tubular reactor at six different temperatures, from 300°C to 550°C, by
mixing TRH and one of the waste biomasses at a 4:1 ratio. The produced biochar was
evaluated for its mass recovery, physicochemical properties, and nitrogen content.
Results revealed that co-pyrolysis of TRH with dried biomass increased the biochar yield
by 20–30% compared to biochar made from raw rice husk. The total nitrogen content of
biochar increased from 0.25% in rice husk biochar to 2.18% in TRH-CF co-pyrolyzed
biochar produced at 350°C. The relative nitrate content of all biochar types is reduced
with increasing pyrolysis temperatures, while the ammonia content increases. The
produced biochar had a slightly elevated pH between 8 and 10, which is an increasing
trend with the higher pyrolysis temperatures. The co-pyrolysis of nitrogen-rich waste
with torrefied rice husk biochar increased the total nitrogen content of the biochar from
0.22% to 2.18% at the optimum temperature of 350°C. It was also found that the chicken
feather co-pyrolysis with TRH at 350°C gave the biochar the highest total nitrogen
content. The outcome of this research implies that the co-pyrolyzing of nitrogen-rich
organic biomass with torrefied rice husks can be developed into a new method for
manufacturing biochar with high nitrogen content.

Throughout human civilization, coffee has long been consumed as a beverage, brewed
from roasted and ground coffee beans taken from an evergreen tropical plant. Due to the
micronutrients present in coffee, there are beneficial effects associated with its
consumption. Coffee roasting is an important step in developing the aromatic and
gustatory qualities of coffee beans using high temperatures. Specialty coffee has recently
emerged as a market segment in coffee trade. In this study, a specialty coffee roaster with
a far infrared heat source was designed and developed for energy efficiency and better
quality roasted coffee beans. The roasting drum and stand of the coffee roaster as well as
the control box were designed and developed, with the capacity to roast batches of 200 g
to 500 g of coffee beans. Automation was done using Arduino. The pulse width
modulation (PWM) method was used with 100%, 85%, 65%, and 50% duty cycles for
heating 2000 W infrared heaters. From the results, 65% duty cycle was selected as the
most efficient. The first crack can be heard at about 8 ± 2 minutes and the optimum
roasting can be achieved in about 15 minutes.

According to the research expertise, obesity has a significant negative impact on the
subfertility of women of childbearing age. Mobile applications have developed and
proven their success in the dissemination of evidence-based scientifically derived
knowledge. Sri Lanka has a higher prevalence of subfertility due to obesity and Poly-
Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Furthermore, within the Sri Lankan context, there is a
gap in the dissemination of scientifically proven knowledge to the target population. The
incapacity to monitor their dietary patterns and behavioral changes regularly and
methodically is a concern. Due to the aforementioned reasons, the awareness among
obese women of childbearing age on the effect of nutrition and lifestyle on subfertility is
low in Sri Lanka. However, user-friendly communication tools have yet to be developed
on dietary behavior, cultural practices, and lifestyle targeting Sri Lankans. Therefore, this
research was conducted to address the void in projecting scientific information to the
target population. The mobile application: ‘Aarya’ was developed in two phases. The
first phase involved developing the educational content, validation, and verification.
Educational content was developed through a literature review, expert consultation, and
interviewing thirty women with a history of obesity, subfertility, and successful
pregnancy. The second phase involved designing, developing, and evaluating the
usability and effectiveness of the application. Evaluation of effectiveness had two stages;
pre-evaluation and post-evaluation. ‘Aarya’ focused on four goals; Body Mass Index
(BMI) and Weight, Diet, Physical Activity, and Mindfulness under the categories:
Dashboard, Assessment, Diary, Journal, and Reminders. There is a ‘Guide’ feature to
provide the required knowledge. ‘Aarya’ integrated and disseminated evidence-based
scientific information in the digital era sustainably. It has increased knowledge and
awareness among selected participants and guided them in self-improvement and self-
reflection integrating into daily life.

Soil moisture content (SMC) is an essential parameter which influences the crop growth
and ecosystem functions. Measuring the soil moisture content using sensors is
advantageous as it allows obtaining SMC measurements at high spatial and temporal
resolutions. Soil moisture sensors are costly to purchase and require technical expertise
to calibrate. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a low-cost sensing system to measure,
transmit, store, and analyze soil moisture content data obtained from field and laboratory
experiments. The system consisted of three main components, a sensor component to
generate a reading, the component to retrieve and send data to a mobile application and
a mobile application to process, manage, and analyze the sensor data. Calibration
relationships between soil moisture content measured using the sensor and oven drying
method were established using repacked soil containers for four main soil great groups,
namely Reddish Brown Latasolic, Immature Brown Loam, Red Yellow Podzolic, and
Non-Calcic Brown. Calibration models of great soil groups were validated using an
independent set of SMC measurements obtained by the oven-drying method. The high
coefficient of determination (R2) values (0.88 - 0.96) of calibration relationships
indicated a strong relationship between the sensor-measured raw values and SMC.
Further, new sensor showed less sensitivity for the measurement of SMC in dry soils.
Low (&lt;3%) root mean square error values resulted in the validation tests indicated high
accuracy of SMC measurements made by the low-cost soil moisture sensor. Further, the
low-cost sensor successfully communicated with the mobile application enabling storage,
retrieval and analysis of data. It is suggested to test the performance of the low-cost sensor
for a wide range of soils and to include a correction factor for saline soils.

The current study was aimed at developing a bioplastic composite using banana (Musa
spp.) pseudostem (BP), cassava (Manihot esculenta) starch and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),
along with plasticizers to replace the plastic packaging for set-yoghurt and identifying
the ideal composition to develop the biocomposite. Banana pseudostems of different
cultivars (Sour Plantain, Sugar Plantain, Ash Plantain, Suwandel and Rath Kesel) were
used in the preparation of the biocomposite using the solvent casting method. The
proximate analysis, Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) and
lignin tests revealed no significant differences (P>0.05) in proximate and van Soest
constituents among the cultivars. Suitability of incorporating lignocellulosic components
as 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35% and 40% (w/w) was tested using PCS10, PCS15,
PCS20, PCS25, PCS30, PCS35, PCS40 and using PCA10, PCA15, PCA20, PCA25,
PCA30, PCA35, PCA40 (w/w) treatments respectively for Sour and Ash Plantain
cultivars selected based on texture analysis of biocomposites. The bioplastic films were
evaluated for the mechanical, chemical, thermal, water absorption, gas permeability and
morphological properties. Tensile strength evaluation resulted lower (P&lt;0.05) values for
PCS25 (1.84±0.08 MPa) and PCA25 (1.26±0.15 MPa) compared to all other treatments.
Elongation at break percentages were lower (P&lt;0.05) for the same samples compared to
all other treatments, with the values of 12.34±1.69% and 3.26±0.78% respectively. Water
absorption percentage at 24 h increased with the lignocellulosic component, recording
the highest (P&lt;0.05) value (88.61±1.32%) for PCS40 biocomposite film. Gas
permeability decreased as the percentage of banana pseudostem increased, resulting the
highest (P&lt;0.05) amount (21.16±0.13%) for the PCA10 biocomposite film. Finally, it is
concluded that biocomposite with 30% BP incorporation from Sour Plantain or Ash
Plantain could provide ideal composition to produce biodegradable packaging for set-
yoghurt.

Coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. There are several
value-added products of coffee. Specialty coffee is one of the most popular and profitable
products of coffee. Specialty coffee represents the strong demand for premium coffee.
Roasting plays a major role in the production of specialty coffee. There is a lack of a
proper roasting machine to produce speciality coffee for Sri Lankan varieties using far-
infrared (FIR) radiation. Temperature profiles are specific for the variety, the roasting
machine &amp; roasting method. Roasting in bulk roasters is less uniform and it is difficult
to follow a temperature profile. This study was conducted to develop a variety specific
temperature profile for the developed FIR based roaster which gives speciality coffee
with expected quality and to automate the optimum roasting process. A python
programme was coded and tested using the developed coffee FIR roaster. It is
experimented that 735 s roasting profile gives too dark colour while 360 s roasting profile
gives light colour. But 420 s roasting profile gives in between 735 s and 360s profile
colour. The roasting profile was successfully followed by the method used in the study.
With a proper controlling mechanism to follow the roasting profile FIR coffee roasting
would be a better roasting mechanism compared to traditional convective roasting
methods.

Development of a Gas Sensor-Based Low-Cost Device to Estimate the
Respiratory Activity of Microbes

Department of Agricultural Engineering,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Measuring microbial activities on a substrate is important to select the best microbes for
biological reactions, the best substrate for a particular type of microbes, to compare the
performance of different types of microbes and different types of substrates for microbes,
and also to understand the biochemical kinetics of microbial processors. In this study, a
low-cost respirometer was designed and fabricated to measure the respiration activities
of microbes on a substrate. The respirometer was designed to measure oxygen
concentration, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature using Figaro KE25 oxygen
sensor, Figaro CDM4160H00 carbon dioxide sensor and LM35 temperature sensor,
respectively. The sensor responses were fed into an Arduino Uno processor embedded in
a circuit board fixed with data logging memory card. The automatic data acquiring, and
logging system was designed using pascal programming. The sensors were calibrated
using standard and inert gases and trial data logging were conducted to verify the
accuracy of logged data. The respirometer testing was done by measuring the oxygen
consumption and carbon dioxide emission from a sample of waste with known substrate
properties. The results showed that the developed respirometer is capable of accurately
measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide and temperature in a closed respirometer assembly
which can be used for estimating microbial respiration activity. The used sensors were
sensitive to high relative humidity; therefore, the system should be improved to avoid the
damage to the system by high relative humidity.

Development of a Liquid Fertilizer by Co-fermentation of Fish Waste and
Azolla Biomass

Sustained high rates of growth in organic agriculture have proven the global need to
consume less contaminated consumables. In organic agriculture systems, the increase of
soil-organic matter to provide a steady release of nutrients to the crops as the organic
matter decays is the underlying concept, where mowed or tilled cover crops, organic
fertilizers, animal manures, and composts play the key roles. Thereby, this study aimed
to produce an organic liquid fertilizer by combining two main biomass sources: fish waste
(FW) and Azolla (AZ). To facilitate microbial activities, the co-fermentation media was
prepared with sugar and yeast, resulting in final AZ:FW:sugar:yeast ratios of 0:5:5:1,
1:4:4:1, 2:3:3:1, and 3:2:2:1, respectively. Finally, water was added to bring the final
mixture's weight up to 3.0 kg. The measurements were taken during the fermentation in
terms of gas emission (Eudiometer), NO3- nitrogen, PO4-3, pH, Electrical conductivity
(EC) and solids content (total solids, dissolved solids, and volatile solids). Results
revealed that the EC of all treatments increased over time, with the final EC lying between
8 and 11.5 mS/cm. There was an initial decrease in pH at the beginning of the co-
fermentation, but all 4 treatments ended with pH values between 4 and 6, making the
final solution acidic. The initial total dissolved solids content was 700 to 1,300 ppm,
rising to 4,000 to 6,000 ppm. There was a prominent NO3- increase (10.28 ppm) in the
first mixture where there was no Azolla added. Also, all the treatments achieved their
highest PO4-3 concentrations at the third week of fermentation (235–730 ppm). The
cumulative gas emission data showed that the highest gas emission was from the fourth
treatment, where the AZ:FW ratio was 3:2. The results of the study support the idea that
Azolla and fish waste can be used to make liquid organic fertilizer.

In the human stomach, foods are digested by a combination of physical and biochemical
processes. The objective of this research was to develop an in vitro gastric digestion
model for analyzing the gastric digestion of food. The continuous peristaltic movement
of the stomach walls was simulated in the gastric digestion model by using contraction
waves that had the frequency of ~ 3 cycles per min that were similar to those observed
in vivo. The gastric digestion model mainly consisted of a butyl rubber chamber,
simulating the stomach chamber, and 4 nylon half rollers attached to 2 rubber belts that
were driven by 2 direct current geared motors and 6 nylon pulleys to create a continuous
contraction of the rubber chamber. The model also incorporated gastric sieving, gastric
secretion, gastric emptying systems, and a temperature control system that enabled
accurate simulation of dynamic gastric conditions. Gastric sieving was done by a 1.5 mm
pore size polyester mesh bag. Gastric emptying was done using a 24 V solenoid valve
which was operated manually using a toggle switch. A peristaltic pump (12 V) which
was programmed using Arduino IDE as the secretion flow rate of 2.5 mL per min was
used to deliver the gastric juice into the gastric chamber. Temperature control system was
consisted of a 100 W bulb, LM 35 temperature sensor, and Arduino Nano, which were
able to maintain the ambient temperature at 37 ℃. The precise control of temperature,
gastric secretion, gastric emptying and the adjustable mechanical driving force in the in
vitro model provide an important tool to analyze food gastric digestion under simulated
physicochemical conditions. Future modifications would enhance the performance of this
in vitro gastric digestion model.

Microbial insecticides are considered an effective and environmentally friendly
alternative to synthetic pesticides. Metarhizium is one of the commonly found
entomopathogenic fungal genera and economical mass rearing is essential when
formulating as a microbial insecticide. The study was aimed to find more effective and
economical media for mass production of Metarhizium sp. Further, the optimum
temperature for culture growth and the best spore harvesting time were determined. The
experiment was carried out to identify the effect of 7 different agricultural byproducts
namely, parboiled rice, refused tea, disposable part of the maize cob (chaff, pith, and
woody ring), ground maize, straw, saw dust and coir dust for mass culturing. The initial
experiment setup was maintained using 25 g of each substrate and at two temperature
levels; at room temperature (28±2 ˚C) and 25 ˚C. Prepared fungal spore suspension (2.5
mL, 1.66×105 spores/mL) was inoculated into each sterilized substrate and thoroughly
mixed and incubated at the two temperature levels. Experiment was continued for 6
weeks and spore concentration and the fungal growth were recorded at a two week
interval. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in spore production at 28± 2 ˚C
and 25 ˚C in all substrates. Spore production was significantly different among the tested
media. The highest spore concentration was found in parboiled rice (14.40×105
spores/mL) at the 6th week. Refused tea, ground maize and disposable parts of the maize
cob showed a mean spore production of 9.14×105, 8.38×105 and 6.40 ×105 spores/mL,
respectively. Maximum spore production was achieved at 28 days after inoculation in all
substrates irrespective of the temperature. Based on the findings, the best medium,
temperature and spore harvesting time can be identified as parboiled rice at room
temperature and at 4 weeks after inoculation, respectively.

This research was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of packaging material and
storage temperature in maintaining the quality of green chili (Capsicum annuum L.) and
scotch bonnet chili (C. chinense) during household storage. Chilies were stored at three
different storage temperatures, i.e., room temperature (27.7 ºC), refrigeration (7.1 ºC),
and clay pot cooler (25.6 ºC), using three different packaging materials (grocery bags,
Ziploc bags, and paper bags) for two weeks. The average relative humidity was 76.1%,
58.2%, and 93.6% in room storage, refrigeration, and clay pot cooler, respectively. The
average cooling efficiency of clay pot coolers was 66.7%. Soluble solids content (SSC),
titratable acidity (TA), physiological weight loss (%), firmness, redness (%), decay (%),
and visual quality of chilies were evaluated every other day. The minimum weight loss
in green chili and scotch bonnet chili was observed in clay pot cooler storage using Ziploc
bags. At all the storage temperatures, the TA increased while SSC was maintained
between 1.5 to 3.0%. Firmness and visual quality were well maintained in the refrigerated
temperature compared to the other storage temperatures. The % redness and decay of
chili were higher (P≤0.05) higher in room and clay pot storage temperatures. Chilies in
Ziploc bags at refrigerated temperature showed the overall best quality during two weeks
of storage. Paper bags were effective in maintaining overall quality of chilies stored at
room temperature and in clay pot cooler.

Specialty coffee is the highest-quality coffee produced in the coffee industry. Grading
coffee beans for the specialty grade is a crucial operation in the production process. All
over the world, manual selection is being practiced for green coffee grading and it
requires a lot of trained labor. As a solution, Image processing technology can be used
effectively to grade coffee beans according to the bean characteristics of specialty grade.
In this study, an algorithm was trained to identify specialty-grade beans in Coffea arabica
using image processing technology. One thousand two hundred images of coffee beans
were captured and trained with OpenCV library. Using the trained algorithm, a specialty
coffee sorter machine was developed, based on feature identification of beans using a
raspberry Pi4 computer and a Pi camera. The sorter machine was specially developed to
grade a single bean at a time under artificial light conditions for better clarity and
accuracy. The developed sorter can reject deformed beans, inert materials, blacked beans,
broken beans, dried cherries, and undersized beans apart from specialty-grade beans. The
developed sorter machine was able to separate accepted and rejected beans with an
overall accuracy of 86.5% and a rate of 10 beans per minute. The false negative rate of
the machine was 0.21. The true positive rate was 0.929, and the false positive rate was
0.06. As further improvements, sorter machine can be developed to grade coffee beans
from Coffea canephora and Coffea liberica by training separate algorithms. Self-learning
capabilities also can be included to the sorter machine to grade coffee beans in different
stages in processing.

Kaolinite is an abundant and low-cost clay mineral that can be used as an adsorbent to
remove hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) from water. The purpose of this research was to
modify the heat-treated kaolinite (metakaolin) with humic acid to produce an effective
adsorbent for Cr (VI) removal from wastewater. The Meetiyagoda raw kaolin was
purified and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy. Strings were prepared from purified
kaolin and heated at 400 ºC, 600 ºC, and 800 ºC, respectively. The XRD, FTIR, and
Raman spectroscopic analysis conducted on heated kaolin strings revealed that
metakaolin is formed at 600 ºC and 800 ºC. In comparison to metakaolin, raw kaolin is
easily dispersed in water due to its low physical stability. Based on the adsorption study,
physically stable metakaolin produced at 600 ºC and 800 ºC were selected for surface
coating with humic acid (HA) and then characterized by FTIR. Isothermal studies for Cr
(VI) removal under optimum pH, adsorbent dosage, and contact time were carried out on
HA + 800 ºC metakaolin and raw kaolin based on information collected from the
adsorption study. The maximum Cr (VI) removal was observed in HA + 800 ºC
metakaolin treated water 43.39 ± 2.90% compared to raw kaolin 65.18 ± 4.43%.
Adsorption data were well-fitted to the nonlinear Langmuir isotherm. The maximum
adsorption capacity of raw kaolin and HA+800 ºC metakaolin were 0.25 ± 0.02 and 0.24
± 0.03 mg/g, respectively at an equilibrium dosage of 15 g/L, equilibrium time of 4 hrs,
and pH of 2. Even though the adsorption capacity results were similar, humic acid-coated
metakaolin is a more effective adsorbent than raw kaolin for the removal of Cr (VI) from
wastewaters in industrial applications due to its physical stability in water.

Plant derivatives have become a viable alternative to the commercial chemotherapeutics
used in aquaculture. A study was conducted to determine the antibacterial activity of 95%
ethanol extracts of three aquatic plants and four land-based plants against the selected
gram-negative virulent bacterial pathogens in fish and shrimp. Commonly available
flowers of Nymphaea stellata, leaves of Salvinia molesta, and Bacopa monneiri were
used as aquatic plants, and leaves of Psidium guajava, Commelina diffusa, Senna alata
and fruits of Phyllanthus emblica were used as land-based plants. The ethanol extracts of
each plant were prepared in 100 ppm, 50 ppm, and 25 ppm concentrations. The
susceptibilities of bacterial suspensions of Vibrio harveyi, Aeromonas hydrophila, and
Edwardsiella tarda to the plant extracts were tested using the agar disk diffusion method.
Distilled water was used as the control. All the means were compared at 95% confidence
level using PROC GLM as a three-way interaction between plant, bacteria and
concentration. The results from the study revealed that the five plant extracts show
positive results and out of them extracts of Nymphaea stellata showed the most
pronounced activity (P&lt;0.05) with a higher inhibition zone against Aeromonas
hydrophila (23.50 ± 0.71 mm) and the same in Vibrio harveyi (22.50 ± 0.71 mm) and
Edwardsiella tarda (22.50 ± 0.71 mm) in 100 ppm concentration. Bacopa monneiri and
Commelina diffusa did not show results for any pathogens. The Minimum Inhibitory
Concentrations (MICs) varied from 6.25 ppm to 100 ppm in extracts with positive results
against all pathogens. The lower MICs were observed in Nymphaea stellata for Vibrio
harveyi (6.25 ppm), Aeromonas hydrophila (12.5 ppm), and Edwardsiella tarda (50
ppm). Thus, Nymphaea stellata extract can be considered as the best potential natural
chemotherapeutic that can be used as an alternative to the commercial chemotherapeutic.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Exploring the spatial variability of soil pH and subsequent mapping are important for soil
management and land use planning. This study assessed the spatial variability of surface
soil pH of the wet zone of Sri Lanka and external factors determining the variability. Four
hundred and three surface soil (0-30 cm) samples obtained across the wet zone were used
in this study. Air-dried soil samples were sieved using a 2 mm sieve and analyzed for pH
by preparing a 1:5 soil to water ratio suspension. Exploratory data analysis conducted
using PASW statistics 18 revealed a large variability of soil pH within the wet zone,
which ranged from 3.0 – 8.8 (coefficient of variation = 16.71%). Thus, soils of the wet
zone of Si Lanka are varied from strongly acidic to strongly alkaline in pH. Average soil
pH revealed that majority of the soils are slightly acidic (pH=5.4). Distribution of soil pH
values did not show regional patterns within the wet zone. Among external factors
considered in this study, only precipitation showed a negative relationship with the soil
pH (r =-0.30). Increased precipitation leads to leaching of basic cations such as Ca+2 and
Mg+2 from the soil system, enriching hydronium ions thus decreasing the soil pH. Other
external factors, namely elevation and temperature did not show a relationship with the
variability of soil pH (r = 0.04 and -0.007, respectively). Analysis of soil pH within
different land uses revealed significantly lower pH values in land uses, namely tea lands,
paddy lands, and rubber lands This study revealed considerable variability in soil pH
between different great soil groups and agro ecological regions of the wet zone. It was
concluded that wet zone of Sri Lanka exemplifies a large spatial variability in pH, which
needs site-specific management to enhance crop production.

Management salt affected soils rely on accurate maps showing spatial patterns of soil
salinity. However, spatial characterization of salinity using conventional soil sampling
and laboratory analysis techniques are laborious and cost prohibitive. This study
attempted to use DUALEM-1S apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) proximal soil
sensor and geographic information system (GIS) to map salt affected areas of a paddy
tract (16 ha) located in the Nellikkadu in Sammanthurai. DUALEM-1S is an
electromagnetic induction based proximal sensor which makes on-the-go measurements
of both ECa of surface (ECa-PRP) and subsurface (ECa-HCP) soils, simultaneously. The
sensor was pulled on paddy lands resulting 14272 measurements of ECa. Surface soil
samples (0-30 cm) were collected at 25 locations identified based on spatial patterns of
ECa and analyzed for EC of saturated soil paste extract (ECe), pH, and Sodium
Adsorption Ratio (SAR). Layers of ECa obtained by inverting sensor measured ECa
revealed distinct patches of salt affected soils in the study area. ECa-PRP showed a strong
linear regression relationship with surface soil ECe (R2=0.9). This relationship was used
to construct salinity map (ECe map) of the study area by combining ordinary kriging and
regression prediction approaches. Fuzzy k-means unsupervised classification of ECe map
of the study area delineated two salinity management zones having high and low levels
of soil salinity (HSMZ and LSMZ, respectively). Soil analysis showed that soils in
HSMZ are saline sodic while soils in LSMZ are non-saline but with high Na content.
High SAR in irrigation water could have contributed for the soil salinity development.
Soil pore water samples analyzed for EC, pH, SAR and K+ showed differences of these
properties between the two management zones. This study revealed fusion of proximal
sensing and GIS technologies has a large potential to support the site-specific
management of soil salinity in paddy grown soils.

Optimizing MS Media and Assessing the Effect on Shoot Multiplication &amp;
Growth by Flurprimidol and IBA for Lomandra Fluviatilis ‘ABU7’ PBR

Lomandra fluviatilis ‘ABU7’ PBR (‘Matt rush’) is an Australian native ornamental grass.
It is the best among the recently introduced Lomandra series to the landscaping industry.
However, compared to other Lomandra varieties, the multiplication rate of the plant in
the currently utilized culture medium is below the productive level in commercial tissue
culture. Therefore, in this study, improving the multiplication rate was attempted. The
best 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) concentration was determined by culturing plants at 0,
0.1, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.55 mg/L concentration levels. They were combined with four
levels of other growth regulators; control, Flurprimidol 1 mg/L, Indole-3-butyric acid
(IBA) 0.1 mg/L &amp; Flurprimidol 1 mg/L + IBA 0.1 mg/L. Flurprimidol was used as a
gibberellin inhibitor because in certain cases, gibberellin can inhibit the formation of
shoots. The effect of Flurprimidol on Lomandra fluviatilis ‘ABU7’ PBR and the role of
IBA in a shoot multiplication medium were also investigated in this study. Flurprimidol
improves the shoot induction as well as root induction of ‘Matt rush’. Additionally, it
increases moisture accumulation inside the plant. Plant height was also controlled by
Flurprimidol. It dwarfs the plant and produces a compact plant which is ideal for
ornamental grasses. IBA plays no role in improving the shoot induction. However, it
improves root induction when combined with Flurprimidol. It does not play a role in
controlling plant height or moisture accumulation. All the parameters of the four levels
of other growth regulators were significantly different (P&lt; 0.05). The negative and
positive impacts of both chemicals balanced-out when combined in a single treatment.
Lower BAP concentrations combined with Flurprimidol + IBA could be recommended
for Matt rush shoot production.

Increasing unfavourable health concerns of milk from improved cattle breeds, the
popularity for milk of indigenous cattle breeds is increasing. Studies have shown that
indigenous cattle milk possesses exceptional milk coagulation properties. However, due
to their low average milk yield, the production of coagulated milk products from
indigenous cattle milk is unpopular. Ultrasound treatment is an emerging non-thermal
technology that can be used to improve milk coagulation properties. In the current study,
the effect of ultrasound treatment to improve the rennet-induced coagulation properties
were evaluated for milk from an indigenous cattle breed, Thamankaduwa White, and an
improved cattle breed, Holstein Friesian. The milk was treated at three ultrasound energy
densities 504, 612, and 720 J mL-1 using a 20 kHz ultrasonicator, and rennet gels were
prepared using Maxiren commercial calf rennet. Water holding capacity, syneresis, and
textural parameters of rennet gels were evaluated. Ultrasound-treated samples from both
breeds showed higher (P&lt;0.05) water holding capacities compared to untreated samples.
In Thamankaduwa White, milk samples treated at 720 J mL-1 showed the highest
(P&lt;0.05) water holding capacity (78.74±5.88 %). In both cattle breeds the syneresis was
reduced (P&lt;0.05) in treated samples compared to untreated samples. Furthermore,
Thamankaduwa White cattle milk showed higher water holding capacity and lower
syneresis (P&lt;0.05) compared to Holstein Friesian milk. In Holstein Friesian milk, the
hardness of rennet gels was reduced (P&lt;0.05) in ultrasound-treated samples. However,
in Thamankaduwa White milk, there was no difference (P>0.05) in hardness values for
rennet gels in both ultrasound-treated and untreated samples. Accordingly, it could be
concluded that ultrasound treatment could be used to improve the rennet-induced
coagulation properties of milk from both Holstein Friesian and Thamankaduwa White
breeds, and the treatment at 720 J mL-1 was more suitable to improve rennet coagulation
properties in Thamankaduwa White cattle milk.

This study was conducted to determine the properties of tanned leather from goat skin
using locally available plant materials: Sweietenia macrophylla (Mahogany), Garcinia
spp (Goaraka), Pinus caribaea (Pine), Camellia sinensis (Refused tea) and commercially
available vegetable tanning materials (Mimosa powder and Black Wattle solid) in Sri
Lanka. Tannins from plant materials were extracted using high pressure water extraction,
and the amounts of tannin were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Leather
tanning was conducted manually, and the re-tanning was not conducted. The physical
properties of the leather were evaluated using the IULTCS (International Union of
Leather Technologists and Chemists Scarcities) official methods of analysis for leather.
The sensory evaluation was done using a three-point hedonic scale. High pressure water
extraction method resulted 6.04±0.12%, 3.34±0.06%, 2.98±0.01%, 3.47±0.11% tannins,
from Mahogany, Goraka, Pine, and refused tea respectively. Significantly higher tannin
absorption levels were achieved by Goraka-tanned goat skin. The physical properties of
leathers produced with different tanning materials not differed significantly (P &lt;0.05).
The highest thickness (2.68±0.19 mm) was obtained in wattle-tanned leather. The highest
apparent density (0.75±0.12 g/cm3), tensile strength parallel to the backbone (29.61±8.77
N/mm2) and perpendicular to the backbone (30.01±14.93 N/mm2) were obtained by Tea-
tanned leather. The highest elongation at break parallel to the backbone (19.70±1.39%)
was obtained by Mimosa-tanned leather. Wattle-tanned leather had the greatest
elongation at the break perpendicular to the backbone (23.33±3.44%). Water absorption
percentage/day (171.33±33.42%) was highest in Mimosa-tanned leather. Goraka,
Mimosa and Wattle tanned leathers tolerated 10,000 flexes compared to others. Goraka-
tanned leathers had the highest overall preference in sensory evaluation. In International
Commission of Illumination (CIELAB) color space, lightness was highest in Mimosa-
tanned leathers, and redness and yellowness were highest in Mahogany-tanned leather.
In conclusion, all the vegetable tanning materials tested resulted leathers with different
favorable properties, and they can all be industrially used to produce various specific
products.

Characterized by the Chlorophyll Fluorescence Transient Analysis
Technique

Department of Crop Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Dracaena sanderiana Sander is a popular and in-demand cut foliage in the global
ornamental industry. It is important to know the performances of these plants under saline
conditions as there is a demand for salt tolerance ornamental plants for poolside
landscaping due to the high chlorine content in the pool water. This study was conducted
to examine the growth performances of 3 varieties of D. sanderiana (‘Gold, ‘White’, and
‘Victory’) under different salinity levels (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mmol NaCl) for 10 weeks.
Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) transient analysis was used to understand the
photosynthetic performances of plants. The ChlF data were collected through OJIP
analysis using a portable fluorometer (Fluor Pen, FP 110). Electrical conductivity (EC)
of the substrate, relative electrolytic leakage (REL) of roots, shoots, and leaves, total
chlorophyll content, and root: shoot ratio (dry weight basis) were measured. EC has
increased with increasing NaCl concentrations indicating the salt buildup in the substrate.
There was no significant difference in the performance index (PI) which is derived from
absorption per reaction center (ABS/RC), maximum quantum yield of primary
photochemistry (ϕPo), and electron transport efficiency (ϕEo) of the ChlF transient
analysis, within the different salinity levels in variety ‘White’ and ‘Victory’. Variety
‘Gold’ showed a reduction in PI in high salt concentrations indicating its sensitivity to
high saline conditions (60 and 80 mmol). Highest REL was observed in roots, followed
by shoots and leaves that explains the protection of leaves from salt stress. We suggest
that D. sanderiana can be used for poolside landscaping as evidenced by ChlF transient
analysis.

Poor germination at final stage of seed certification leads to rejections in seeds produced
as planting materials by the Department of Agriculture of Sri Lanka. Seed priming is one
possible option to overcome such problem where a pre-sowing treatment is used for
improving the germination. In Cucurbit crops, due to hard seed coat, germination is
usually low. To identify the suitable priming methods for Cucurbitaceae, to evaluate the
effects of various priming treatments and also to reduce the rejection rate in certified
seeds, this experiment was conducted in Seed Certification Services Laboratory at
Gannoruwa as a two factor factorial experiment in completely randomized design with
three different priming treatments (hydro priming, osmo priming and halo priming) with
control (non-primed) and two seed types (accepted and rejected) for two crops. bitter
gourd (Momordica charantia) and snake gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) belonging
to the family Cucurbitaceae. By this experiment, effects of priming treatments were
investigated on parameters such as germination percentage, moisture percentage,
electrical conductivity, seed microflora, shoot and root length (cm), seedling length (cm)
seedling vigor index and chlorophyll fluorescence. According to the statistical analyses,
there were no significant differences at level of P&lt;0.05 for moisture percentage, shoot
and root length and seedling length except for electrical conductivity, germination
percentage and seedling vigor index. In accepted seeds of bitter gourd, osmo priming
showed the greatest increase in germination whereas in rejected seeds, all three priming
methods significantly increased seed germination compared to control. All priming
treatments have increased the seedling quality in rejected snake gourd seeds compared to
the control. According to the results, all three priming treatments have been able to
improve the seed germination in rejected bitter gourd and snake gourd seeds.

Coffee is the most consumed beverage in the world besides water and the most traded
agricultural commodity. Roasting is the most important step in coffee processing.
Rotating in batch roasters using convective heating is popular in the industry. But the use
of convective heating consumes more time and energy. The gradual heating of coffee
beans under a low temperature gradient with convective heating causes excessive
caramelization and deterioration of organoleptic properties in roasted coffee. Far-infrared
(FIR) radiation causes rapid heating of coffee beans which eliminates the above
problems. The temperature profile of coffee beans roasted under far-infrared radiation
has been studied in this study to optimize the FIR coffee roasting. The temperature
profile inside coffee beans and the surface temperature of the beans exposed to far-
infrared radiation was simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics. Coffea arabica beans
were singularly roasted in an experimental setup and the temperature-time curves were
plotted to validate the model. Sets of 12 coffee beans in each batch were roasted for five
time intervals (20 s, 25 s, 30s , 35 s and 45 s) to determine the roasting degrees of coffee
roasted under FIR. A good agreement between the simulated data from the model and
experimented data was observed (RMSE of 25.3C at the 25% duty cycle, 35.6C at the
17.5% duty cycle, 37.2C at the 10% duty cycle). It can be concluded that FIR can be
effectively used for coffee roasting and the roasting is much faster (internal temperature
reach 300C in 44s) than the traditional convective heating. All three roasting degrees;
light roast, medium roast and dark roast can be obtained by roasting with FIR.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Statistical process control is a mechanism of examining the variability of the considered
quality parameters. Out of control instances are identified by shifts from the standard
mean value and high variability. Evaluation of the quality of latex crepe manufacturing
process in the Dartonfield factory was done considering applied dosages of sodium
bisulfite, bleaching agent and formic acid. Moving range charts (MR chart), individual
value charts (I chart) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts were used as tools for quality
assurance of latex crepe manufacturing process under this study. MR chart was used to
study the stability of the process whereas I charts were used to identify out of control
chemical applications. Change point analysis was done for CUSUM charts to detect
trends in chemical applications. CUSUM charts can detect fluctuations in properties of
quality parameters within a narrow range. Ranked CUSUM charts can be plotted if the
variability of the data is high, or error structure of the data is non independent. According
to the results, application of sodium bisulfite, bleaching agent and formic acid were done
according to the RRI recommendations. Chemical application in crepe rubber
manufacturing process was stable and under control except in 13th of May 2022.
Although addition of sodium bisulfite has fluctuated during 2021-2022, it has been within
standard control limits (computed using 2004 standard data set) according to both
individual and moving range charts. According to moving range charts for added
bleaching agent and formic acid dosages, they have been within standard limits.

The zero-energy clay pot coolers are an eco-friendly system with low construction costs.
This technology is based on the principles of a passive evaporative cooling mechanism.
Clay pot coolers have been shown to effectively increase the shelf-life of many fresh
commodities. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the
evaporative clay pot coolers in preserving the postharvest quality of four selected leafy
vegetables including, kankun (Ipomoea aquatica), gotukola (Centella asiatica), lettuce
(Lactuca sativa) and thampala (Amaranthus spp.). Freshly harvested leafy vegetables
were separated into bundles weighing about 200 g and stored under three different storage
conditions, i.e., room temperature storage, refrigerated storage, and clay pot cooler
storage, for seven days. The average temperatures and relative humidity in room
temperature storage, refrigerated storage, and clay pot cooler storage were 27.7 ºC and
76.1%, 7.1 ºC and 58.2%, and 25.6 ºC and 93.6%, respectively. Average cooling
efficiency of clay pot coolers was 66.7%. The physiological weight losses of leafy
vegetables were significantly reduced during clay pot cooler storage. At the end of the
storage period, chlorophyll content, soluble solids content, color changes, and the visual
quality of leafy vegetables were significantly maintained in clay pot cooler storage
compared to room temperature storage. Based on the results of this study, it can be
concluded that the clay pot cooler is a better alternative storage method to preserve the
quality of leafy vegetables during their storage.

Cutaneous mange is highly contagious, which leads to severe wounds later, thus,
resulting economic losses to the farmers if not treated on time. In this study, the
effectiveness of a herbal spray, which is prepared using a traditional herbal recipe for
controlling mange infestation in pigs, was investigated. Herbal materials have wound-
healing abilities, antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic, and anthelmintic properties. The
prepared herbal spray was applied daily on the affected area of mange-infested pigs and
the prognosis was evaluated for 21 days at 07-day intervals. Efficacy was evaluated using
a numerical scale based on the severity of clinical symptoms and behavioural signs at the
initial treatment. A score of 0 was given to pigs with no symptoms, while a score of 100
was given to pigs showing severe clinical symptoms. Scores between 0-100 were given
accordingly to pigs in between. The post-treatment evaluation was done using the same
scale. The herbal spray was also tested against balb/c mice to observe the wound healing
process as well. Animals with non-treated wounds served as the control. The data were
statistically analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The results showed that
applying this herbal spray significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved wound healing in pigs when
compared with the control. In conclusion, this herbal spray is effective in healing
cutaneous wounds resulting from mange in pigs, and the spray is highly effective for
controlling general skin infections too. Therefore, this herbal spray has a potential for
commercialization to control the mange and skin wounds in pigs. However, further
studies have to be conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the herbal spray on other
farm and pet animals.

Conventional mass and energy calculations are lengthy, time consuming and
visualization is difficult when it comes to higher order simulations. Thus, use of CFD
tools for modeling is more efficient and sophisticated. In this study, heat transfer in two
cylindrical geometries of a double barrel batch pyrolysis reactor having an inner pyrolysis
chamber and outer combustion chamber was mathematically built. Finite element
analysis of physical geometry using COMSOL® Multiphysics software was done.
Finding the appropriate temperature distribution in the combustion zone to achieve the
minimum temperature of 4500C for 30 minutes duration in the inner pyrolysis chamber
was the objective of model simulation. Rice husk was used as the feedstock for pyrolysis
while dried Gilicidia (Gliricidia sepium) biomass was used as the combustion biomass
both in simulation and actual field testing. During the field experiment at Meewatura
experimental station, four K-type thermocouples were placed along the vertical axis of
the outer chamber to capture the temperature profile during the twenty-two hours of
reactor operation process. According to COMSOL® Multiphysics simulation model, the
temperature of the combustion zone should reach minimum of 6000C temperature to
ensue pyrolysis at 4500C in pyrolysis chamber. The field testing of actual reactor showed
that the combustion zone temperature reached 8000C and retain a minimum of 90 minutes
giving adequate temperature and retention time for paddy husk pyrolysis at 4500C. In
conclusion, it was found that COMSOL® Multiphysics simulation model can be
effectively used to simulate the heat transfer mechanism of Double Barrel Batch
Pyrolysis Reactor.

water. Generally, the surface of biochar is negatively charged, which restricts its affinity
for phosphate anion adsorption. In this study, biochar was produced by pyrolyzing
coconut shells at 400 ºC and modified with iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg) to remove
phosphate from water. To evaluate the performance of Fe- and Mg-modified biochar on
phosphate removal from water, batch adsorption tests were conducted. The optimum
time, dosage, and pH for phosphate adsorption were determined for both unmodified and
modified biochars. The pH of the unmodified and modified biochars were 7.35 and 3.66,
respectively. The Electrical conductivity of the unmodified biochar was 900 µS cm-1
while that of the modified biochar was 600 µS cm-1. The overall effect of modified
biochar materials on phosphate adsorption was significantly higher than that of
unmodified biochar materials (P&lt;0.05). When the modified biochar dose reached 10 g/L,
the phosphate removal efficiency increased to a maximum of 97.80%. Modified biochar
exhibits 72.14% adsorption after 10 minutes and then increased to a maximum of 81.89%
after one hour. Hence, the optimum time period for the adsorption of modified biochar is
one hour. The phosphate adsorption capacity of modified biochar was unaffected by pH.
But at pH 9, unmodified biochar samples exhibited a small increase in phosphate
adsorption. According to these findings, it can be concluded that Fe- and Mg-modified
biochar can be used as a low-cost adsorbent to remediate eutrophic water.

The prevailing priority to stimulate the transition towards a circular economy expanded
the tempo of the search for alternatives in the forms of biofuels, biomaterials, bio-based
adsorbents, and other value-added components. Thereby, resource recovery techniques
such as thermochemical conversions can present more sustainable solutions to waste
management than conventional dumping and burning practices. Agricultural wastes are
produced in massive quantities worldwide and comprise a range of feedstocks, making
them potentially valuable inputs to support resource circularity. This study focused on
the resource recovery through co-pyrolysis of two major waste types from the agricultural
industry: weed biomass (WB) and waste plastic mulch (WPM). Six invasive WB species,
Wal Suriyakantha (Tithonia diversifolia), Ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala), Baloliya
(Lantana camara), Katakalu bovitiya (Clidemia hirta), Podisinchomaran (Eupatorium
odoratum), and Wedelia (Sphagneticola trilobata) were co-pyrolyzed with WPM at
550°C, in six different WB:WPM mass ratios of 100:0, 99.75:0.25, 97.5:2.5, 95:5,
92.5:7.5, and 90:10, respectively. The physical, chemical, and surface morphological
characteristics of the produced biochar were analyzed to evaluate its suitability as soil
amendments or adsorbents. The results showed that increasing the plastic ratio of the
mixture decreased the biochar yield by 1-5%, with Katakalu bovitiya having the highest
biochar recovery (31%) and Wal suriyakantha having the lowest recovery (28%).
Increasing the PM content also increased the volatile matter content by 1–7%. The pH
values of all the biochar samples were between 10 and 12, making them more suitable
for soil acidity treatment. The FTIR analysis showed that there are prominent surface
functional groups like carbonyl in the biochar, and alkene groups may be present due to
PM. In conclusion, it can be stated that the co-pyrolysis of invasive weed biomass and
waste agricultural plastic mulch is a potential agricultural waste valorization technique.

Aflatoxins in Commonly Used Feed Raw Materials:
A Quantitative Analysis

Department of Animal Science,

Aflatoxins produced mainly by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus are known
to be carcinogenic and mutagenic. Aflatoxins concentration (AC) in feed raw materials
such as maize, wheat and rice by-products can exceed the threshold levels resulting in
reduced quality of feed produced. This study aimed to quantify the AC and its association
with other nutrients such as moisture, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre and ash in
commonly used feed raw materials. Two-year (2021-2022) data of AC and proximate
composition (PC) of commonly used feed raw materials were extracted from a database
of one of the largest concentrate feed manufacturers in Sri Lanka. The data were then
analyzed using R software version 4.01, and the associations between PC and AC were
quantified using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). The
number of PCA components was determined using both Eigen values and Monte Carlo
PCA simulation. The highest crude protein was found in Meat &amp; Bone Meal (50.3±1.8%)
and the lowest in Palm Kernel Meal (17.8±1.5%) of the protein sources used in feed
formulation. The Dried Distillers Grains had the highest moisture content (14.9±1.8%)
and Meat &amp; Bone Meal had the lowest moisture content (3.4±2.0 %). Overall, the AC of
most of the raw materials used in feed processing exceeded the threshold of 20 µg/kg
with the lowest level being observed in Boll Rice (4.9±1.2 µg/kg) and the highest
(55.5±58.3 µg/kg) in Dried Distillers Grains. The correlation coefficients ranged from -
0.68 to 0.57 and aflatoxin concentrations were poorly associated with feed nutrients
except for moisture content (r=0.35). Therefore, these findings suggest that the aflatoxins
concentration in feed raw materials increases when moisture content increases. This
suggests that proper drying of raw materials should be encouraged prior to feed storage
and processing to reduce the aflatoxins concentration in feed raw materials.

Glycation is a non-enzymatic reaction occurring in human body which leads to
occurrence of various non-communicable diseases. In a person with chronic
hyperglycemia, glycation occurs at higher rates resulting in chronic diabetic
complications. With the objective of identifying potentially safe natural sources with
glycation inhibition properties, lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) whole plant, turmeric
(Curcuma longa) rhizome, Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) bark, piperine
95, a pure extract from Piper nigrum and ginger (Zingiber Officinale) rhizome were
studied. The plant material for the study was collected through the Department of Export
Agriculture. Dried and powdered samples were extracted three times with distilled water
using ultra-sonic assisted extraction method. Aqueous extracts were first concentrated
through rotary evaporation at 50 oC and then freeze-dried. Freeze dried samples were re-
dissolved in distilled water to obtain the test samples in a concentration series of 200
mg/mL–0.625 mg/mL. Chicken egg lysozyme was incubated with fructose in a phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 oC for 30 days in the presence and absence (negative control) of
prepared plant extracts. Aminoguanidine was used as standard glycation inhibitor in
positive control and blank samples included only plant extracts incubated in lysozyme.
Aliquots of samples were obtained on day 7 and 21 of incubation and analyzed along
with molecular weight markers (MW) using sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to identify the inhibition effect against glycation induced
cross linking of proteins. On day 7 compared to negative and the positive control, C.
zeylanicum indicated the highest antiglycation activity resulting in a complete glycation
inhibition at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. On day 21 both C. citratus and C. zeylanicum
showed complete inhibition of cross-linking at 0.5 mg/mL concentration which was the
highest inhibition activity. On both days C. domestica indicated the lowest antiglycation
activity. In conclusion, among the studied plant extracts C. citratus and C. zeylanicum
indicated the highest In vitro antiglycation activity.

Applications and Usages of Different Prebiotics in the Dairy Industry:
A Review
Adheela M.N.F. and Prasanna P.H.P.*
Department of Animal Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Prebiotics are indigestible dietary elements that may benefit the host and stimulate the
growth of selective probiotics, particularly those that stimulate the growth of bifidogenic
and lactic acid bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Prebiotics cannot be digested by small
intestinal enzymes but are fermented by probiotic bacteria in the large intestine.
Prebiotics can be classified in a variety of ways according to their chemical makeup,
chain length or degree of polymerization, and the form of application. Prebiotics are
found in several vegetables and fruits and are considered functional food components.
During the selective fermentation process of colonic bacteria, it produces metabolic
products such as hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, short-chain fatty acids, and lactate
via various carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes, which provide energy to probiotic
bacteria. Some findings claim that prebiotics play a role in reducing the risk and severity
of gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative
colitis, bowel function disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase
the bioavailability and uptake of minerals, and data suggest that they reduce the risk of
obesity by promoting satiety and weight loss. They are used in many food applications
including dairy products. Much research has been focused on using probiotics and
prebiotics, generally known as synbiotics in dairy products.

The economic return and the sustainability of a dairy farm significantly depends on the
quality of the milk produced by the farm. Unstable Non Acid Milk (UNAM) is a common
quality defect identified in cow milk, but not been studied adequately. In Sri Lanka,
ethanol stability test is commonly being used as a measure of heat stability of raw milk.
Ethanol instability occurs as a result of increased ionized calcium level due to various
reasons, causing rejection of milk in considerable amounts. Considering the importance
of early detection of UNAM, the present study was carried out to determine the suitability
of cow urine pH as an indicator to detect UNAM. In this study, milk and urine samples
were collected from 35 lactating cows three times, two weeks apart from 5 dairy farms
around Kandy and transported at 4°C for further analyses. All milk samples were tested
in duplicates for ethanol stability (68%, 70%, 72%, and 74%), acidity, resazurine, pH,
fat, lactose, solid-non-fat and protein percentages while urine samples were tested for pH
using a pH meter. Binary logistic regression between pH value of urine and response to
ethanol stability test under series of percentages were evaluated. Separate models were
developed for each ethanol percentage. The chi-square values for goodness fit test for the
model fit for each ethanol concentrations were not significantly different (p>0.05).
Although, there was no strong correlation of statistical significance between cow urine
pH and UNAM, correlation of urine pH with 70% alcohol stability was quite close to be
significant. The present study did not find a strong positive correlation of any statistical
significance between cow urine pH and UNAM. However, small sample size may have
compromised statistics and therefore, it is suggested to carry out further studies with more
samples from milking cows.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential of replacing sodium metabisulfite
(SMS) in hard dough biscuits with a microbial protease enzyme (Veron HPP). The effect
of enzyme addition on biscuit quality was investigated by comparing 6 treatments (T1:20
mg/kg, T2:40 mg/kg, T3:60 mg/kg, T4:80 mg/kg, T5:100 mg/kg, T6:120 mg/kg) with the
control (SMS, 400 mg/kg). The biscuits were prepared with similar height and shape and
baked at 180 °C for 9 min. The biscuit hardness was analyzed using a texture analyzer.
The T4, T5, and T6 treatments had significantly lower hardness (P&lt;0.05) compared to
the control. Therefore, only T1, T2, and T3 were further evaluated. The proximate
composition, spread ratio, color, and sensory properties of the selected treatments were
compared with the control. Aerobic plate count and yeast and mould count were
determined after 4 weeks of storage time. There was no significant difference (P>0.05)
in the moisture, crude protein and ash contents, or color of the treatments compared to
the control. T1 treatment had a significantly higher spread ratio compared to the control
(control: 6.96 ± 0.64 vs. T1:10.309 ± 1.211, P&lt;0.05). According to the sensory evaluation
for texture, T2 had the highest preference while T3 had the least preference. The aerobic
plate count of all treatments was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than the control. The yeast
and mould count of biscuits was less than 1 for all the treatments and the control after 4
weeks of storage. Based on the sensory results, T2 could be selected as the best
formulation for hard dough biscuit with the microbial protease enzyme. Further studies
are required to evaluate the shelf life and to determine a suitable packaging material for
the developed biscuits.

This study investigated the bioavailability of antioxidants, minerals, and heavy metals in
two selected edible seaweed species in Sri Lanka: Kappaphycus alvarezii and Caulerpa
lentillifera. The collected seaweed samples were dried at 55 C, powdered and subjected
to in vitro digestion using synthetic gastrointestinal enzymes. A dialysis membrane of 12
kDa molecular cut-off was used to simulate intestinal absorption. Total Phenolic Content
(TPC) and Total Flavonoid Content (TFC) in seaweed powder and the bioavailable
fraction of digested seaweed were measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu method and
Aluminum chloride colorimetric assay, respectively. The antioxidant activity was
determined using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryl-hyrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging
activity, 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical
scavenging activity and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assays. The mineral
(Fe, K, Mg, Al, Zn) and heavy metal (Cd, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Mo, V) contents of seaweed
powder and bioavailable fraction were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma –
Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The TPC of the bioavailable fractions of K.
alvarezii and C. lentillifera were 1.47±0.01 and 1.76±0.04 mg GAE/g, respectively.
These values were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than the TPC in powdered seaweeds
(0.76±04 mg GAE/g DW and 1.06±04 mg GAE/g DW respectively) showing that the
simulated digestion had improved the polyphenol bioavailability in the studied seaweeds.
The TFC in both seaweed powder and bioavailable fraction were not within the detectable
limit. Compared to powdered seaweeds, bioavailable fractions showed a significantly
(P&lt;0.05) higher antioxidant capacity for ABTS assay and a significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower
antioxidant capacity for DPPH assay. For FRAP assay, C. lentillifera showed
significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher antioxidant capacity than powdered seaweed. Both mineral
and heavy metal bioavailability were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in K. alvarezii than in
C. lentillifera. Results revealed that digestion significantly affects polyphenolic and
mineral bioavailability. These seaweeds have the potential to address micronutrient
malnutrition and oxidative stress-related diseases.

The present study aimed to characterize the proximate composition, antimicrobial and
antioxidant activities of five seaweed species namely, Kappaphucus alvarezii (Dotty
dotty), Sargassum wightii (Gulf weed), Turbinaria ornata (Crowded sea bell), Caulerpa
peltata (Saucer algae) and Caulerpa lentillifera (Sea grapes), which were collected from
different areas in Jaffna district in Sri Lanka. After cleaning and washing, the samples
were dried at 55 ℃ and ground to a powder. Proximate composition was measured in
dried seaweed powder. The antioxidant activities were determined in water extracts of
seaweed powder using three different assays: Total Phenolic Content (TPC), Ferric
Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assay and 2, 2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)
radical scavenging activity. Crude methanol and crude water extracts of seaweeds were
examined for antimicrobial properties against four selected pathogens (Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans). The proximate
composition and antioxidant properties varied significantly (P&lt;0.05) among seaweed
species. The two green seaweeds, i.e., C. peltata and C. lentillifera had the highest
(P&lt;0.05) protein, fat and gross energy contents while the other three seaweeds had
significantly (P&lt;0.05) high ash contents. The water extracts of brown seaweed, S. wightii
showed the highest (P&lt;0.05) TPC and FRAP, whereas red seaweed, K. alvarezii had the
highest (P&lt;0.05) DPPH radical scavenging activity. Methanol extracts of the five
seaweed species showed antimicrobial activity against four pathogens tested, whereas the
crude water extracts of two seaweed species tested (K. alvarezii and T. ornata) showed
antimicrobial activity only against P. aeruginosa. Present results showed that the five
selected Sri Lankan seaweeds contain high nutritional value, antioxidant and
antimicrobial properties and, have a potential to be used as a food or food additive that
can help to reduce malnutrition and non-communicable oxidative stress-related diseases.

Bee honey and garlic are used as valuable medicine from ancient times due to their
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-cancer properties. The combination
of garlic and bee honey is considered as an ayurvedic remedy to improve cardiovascular
health, weight loss and for hypoglycemic effect. The reason for this is both garlic and bee
honey are rich in antioxidants. The objective of this study was to identify the post-
prandial glycemic response of garlic-bee honey combination. Furthermore, the
physicochemical properties of the garlic and bee honey combined product was accessed.
The measured parameters were viscosity, pH, acidity, sugar content, moisture content
and water activity. The results of the proximate analysis revealed that the carbohydrate
content of bee honey and the garlic-bee honey product was 79.9% and 73%, respectively.
Additionally, the garlic-bee honey product contains 1.6% protein, 0.4% ash, 25%
moisture and fat was not detected. The glycemic index (GI) test was conducted using 11
healthy subjects aged between 22-25 years, mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of 20.8 ± 1.9.
The GI was measured according to ISO 26642:2010 (E). Participants were given 50 g of
glucose as the reference food. Bee honey garlic product which contains 50 g of available
carbohydrate was given. The results of the GI test revealed that bee honey had a mean GI
of 57 ± 6.10 (medium GI) and for the garlic-bee honey product was 66 ± 8.14 (medium
GI) with no significant difference (P>0.05). Therefore, the research concludes that,
compared to the table sugar (reported GI ≈ 80) the garlic-bee honey product can be
recommended for diabetic patients as it is a medium GI food as well as due to its reported
high antioxidant capacity. It is suggested that further tests should be done to determine
the long-term effect of the garlic-bee honey product on human health.

Comparative Evaluation of Five Traditional Methods to Reduce Storage
Pest Damage of Mung Bean (Vigna radiata)
Bandara D.M.T.S. and Jayasinghe W.H.*
Department of Agricultural Biology,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
We evaluated five traditional methods commonly-used in Sri Lanka to minimize losses
due to storage pest attacks of mung bean. These methods have become popular at present
due to high cost and unavailability of chemical pesticides and potential health risks. Mung
bean grains were mixed with wood ash, dried neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, dried
lime (Citrus aurantiifolia) leaves, a mixture of dried neem and lime leaves and dried
lantana (Lantana camara) flowers. These experimental units (i.e. plastic boxes with
grains mixed with the treatments and control) were kept at room temperature and allowed
natural infestation. Species identification, number of adult pests, seeds with holes and
seeds with eggs, living adults, pupae and larvae were counted at thirty-day intervals over
a storage period of two months. Callosobruchus chinensis was reported as the major
storage pest of mung bean. In the untreated control, a higher number of grains were
damaged by C. chinensis. Pest population was suppressed significantly (P=0.001) in
dried neem leaf treatment compared to other treatments. Number of seeds with holes and
the seeds with eggs were reduced significantly in neem treated-mung bean samples
(P=0.003 and P=0.000, respectively). There was no significant effect by any treatment
on living larvae and pupae inside the seeds (P=0.327). The lowest yield loss was recorded
in neem-treated samples (12.92%) during the storage period of two months. Therefore,
mixing grains with dried neem leaves was identified as the best postharvest treatment for
short duration storage (two months) of mung bean at household level.

Curd is an extensively consumed traditional fermented dairy product in Sri Lanka. The
repeated usage of defined starter culture in commercial curd production leads to a
constant host for bacteriophage proliferation. These bacteriophages cause the low rate of
lactic acid production during fermentation process which causes undesirable product
quality, thereby considerable economic losses. Rotation of the starter culture has been
identified as a good solution to avoid this. Therefore, this study was conducted with the
objective of identifying the suitable starter cultures/culture combination for cow curd
preparation that can be used for culture rotation process. The physiochemical,
microbiological and organoleptic properties were evaluated to identify the most suitable
starter cultures for cow curd production. Four starter cultures; Delvo FVV 211 (T1), Chr
Hansen YoFlex® SLB 3.0 (T2), Sacco KD2 (T3) and a combination of Delvo FVV 211
+ Sacco KD2 (T4), as a control a culture of pre-prepared buffalo curd (PPBC) was used
(T5). One way ANOVA and Friedman test were used to analyze data. The curd produced
with Delvo FVV 211 showed the lowest (P&lt;0.05) mean pH (3.64±0.00) compared to the
control (3.94±0.02) toward 14th day of storage in refrigerator (4CO). The organoleptic
properties were evaluated by twenty untrained panelists with 5-point hedonic scale. The
curd produced using a combination of Delvo FVV 211 + Sacco KD2 (T4) received the
highest rank for taste while other properties had no difference. The control showed a
higher (P&lt;0.05) mean yeast count (2.90±0.08 log cfu/g) during the fifteen days of storage
in refrigerator. However there was no significant mold growth in any of the sample during
storage. In conclusion, a combination of Delvo FVV 211 + Sacco KD2 cultures was
identified as the best option for culture rotation practices in cow curd production.

Blending is a common practice to enhance the sensory attributes, stability, quantity and
economic benefits. Tea blending is mixing of more than two varieties of single line made
from seven regions of tea growing areas in Sri Lanka. Characteristics and quality of tea
are typically influenced by the genetic make-up of tea variety, agroclimatic conditions,
elevation, chemical makeup of green leaf, maturity of leaf and plucking method. This
research was conducted to identify the deviation in-between pilot run and mass
production of selected blend on liquor colour, liquor strength, infusion colour, infusion
aroma and bulk density, tapped density, and compressibility index of blended tea.
Samples were collected from seven batches of pilot run and mass production. Sensory
evaluation was conducted by the tea tasters and semi-trained panels. “Hue” and
“Chroma” values of tea brew, blended tea, and infusion were determined. There was a
significant difference between the blend of pilot run and mass production on tapped
density, liquor strength and aroma infusion (p&lt;0.05) There was no significant difference
in bulk density, compressibility index, and colour of the tea liquor of the tea blends
obtained from the pilot run and mass production. Deviation of tapped density between
pilot run and mass production was minimized by selecting hand blending technique with
adequately splitting the batches into several portions during blending. Careful selection
of pure tea lines for blending and tasting prior to formulation and blending are potential
practices to reduce the deviation in-between pilot run and mass production in liquor
strength and infusion aroma.

Tea is the oldest, mostly consumed nonalcoholic plant-based beverage in the world.
Ready-to-Drink (RTD) tea is one of the popular value-added products among consumers
worldwide. RTD tea is processed by brewing the made tea, and dissolving tea concentrate
or powder with other ingredients such as flavours, colourants, acidity regulators, sugar,
or sweeteners. Due to the increasing consumer demand, RTD teas are available with
different flavours and colours. Thus, evaluation of physicochemical, microbiological, and
sensory attributes plays a significant role. This study was conducted to evaluate and
compare the physicochemical parameters, microbiological quality, and sensory attributes
of two brands (A and B) of artificially flavoured commercially available RTD tea in Sri
Lanka. The pH, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity, colour, total plate count
(TPC), yeast and mold count and sensory attributes were determined in apple, lemon,
peach, and strawberry flavoured RTD products. According to the results, the pH and TSS
were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) in two brands in all flavours. The pH and Brix value
varied between 1.61-3.65 and 6.8-8.2 respectively. Acidity varied between 0.26-0.45 %
and showed a significant difference (P&lt;0.05) between the two brands for apple, lemon,
and strawberry flavours. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in hue values
(0.50-1.37) between the two brands. The TPC was 0 cfu/mL for all the samples while
yeast and mold count was 0 cfu/mL for both brands except for the lemon flavour in brand
B. Considering the overall sensory evaluation, the apple flavour of both A and B brands
had a better sensory profile compared to other flavours. In conclusion, all flavoured teas
of both A and B brands had microbial safety and acceptable sensory attributes as a RTD
tea beverage.

Boiled sweet corn is a favourite food in Europe. Sri Lanka recently cultivates sweet corn
targeting to produce ready-to-eat entire sweet corn cobs as well as canned sweet corn in
a brine solution. Because of low acidity (5.9 - 6.2), sweet corn is susceptible to the growth
of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. In the food industry, thermal processing is
the most common process which enable to manufacture microbiologically safe food and
extend the useful shelf-life of foods. The research was conducted to find out the optimum
time and temperature combination for the retorting process of ready-to-eat sweet corn
cob pouches and to validate the process. The selection of raw materials, the effect of the
blanching process, suitable time and temperature combinations for the retort process,
physicochemical parameters for the final product, and sensory attributes such as colour,
flavour, texture, and overall acceptability were assessed and compared among different
time and temperature treatments. Sensory evaluation was done by using a hedonic
ranking test and a 9-point hedonic rating test. Water that was used to clean and process
steps were microbiologically safe as well as the processing environment also
microbiologically safe. According to the results, 115 ℃ for 25 min and 116 ℃ for 15
min could be used effectively in the retort process. There was no significant difference
(p>0.05) in physicochemical properties such as texture and salinity among the above
treatments, but considering the sensory evaluation done using hedonic test, it was
confirmed that most consumers preferred sweet corn processed at 116 ℃ for 15 min.
Furthermore, the results of microbial validation support proving that the selected time
and temperature combination would be adequate to destroy the spores of Clostridium
perfringens and to maintain the expected shelf-life of 10 months.

It is important to deliver safe carbonated fruit beverages to the market. The aim of this
research was to determine the optimum time-temperature combination for the
pasteurization of carbonated fruit beverages and estimate the shelf-life. The optimum
time-temperature combination was determined by subjecting the samples into different
pasteurization conditions (63 C/5 min, 63 C/10 min, 71 C/5 min, 71 C/10 min, 75
C/5 min, 75 C/10 min, 80 C/5 min and 80 C/10 min) with or without sorbic acid
as a preservative. The effectiveness of the appropriate time-temperature combination was
measured using the yeast and mold count and it was considered as the critical factor for
shelf-life determination. The shelf-life was determined based on the optimum heat
treatment. Heat treated beverage cans were stored at accelerated temperatures of 35 C,
45 C for 9 weeks to evaluate the pH, acidity (%), total soluble solids (°Brix) and yeast
and mold count (cfu/ml) in every week. The shelf-life of the product was determined by
the accelerated shelf-life method using the Arrhenius model. The Q10 values were
obtained from the model and literature data to calculate the estimated and predicted shelf-
life, respectively. Based on the results, lowest heat treatment of 63 C/5 min was not
recommended for the pasteurization. However, heat treatment of 71 C/10 min was
recommended for the pasteurization. It was observed that, the quality attributes such as
acidity, pH and °Brix of the product decreased with time. Based on the Arrhenius model,
the growth of yeast and mold followed the first-order reaction. The change in yeast and
mold count was used to estimate the shelf-life of carbonated fruit beverages in terms of
microbial safety. According to the accelerated shelf-life model, the estimated shelf-life
of carbonated fruit beverage (without preservative) was 15.44 weeks at room temperature
(25 °C) and the predicted shelf-life for carbonated fruit beverage (without preservative)
was 35.76 weeks at room temperature.

Fast growth of sales of plant-based foods indicates their better demand over traditional
meats and animal-based products. In many countries, percentage of consumers opting for
vegan diets has increased, as reflected by the growth of vegan food market. As busy
lifestyles of consumers restrict making healthy food choices, this study focused on
developing a ready-to-cook powder-based formula of a scrambled egg vegan analogue
(SEVA). Four formulae were prepared using cowpea flour (CF) and soybean flour (SF)
in different ratios (100% CF, 3:1-CF:SF, 2:1-CF:SF and 1:1-CF:SF) as treatments in
triplicate. Liquid soy lecithin (LSL), turmeric powder, baking powder, baking soda,
carboxy methyl cellulose, citric acid powder, salt, coconut oil and coconut milk were
used in equal proportions to prepare SEVAs. The best formula selected based on hardness
of SEVAs. Hardness of the four SEVAs were significantly different (P&lt;0.05), and the
formula (1:1-CF:SF) resulted in the lowest hardness was selected for further experiments.
The selected formula (1:1-CF:SF) containing LSL was used as the control and formulae
containing three levels of Palsgaard® DMG 0093 (PDMG-0093) powder (1.0, 0.5 and
0.1%) were used as treatments in triplicate. Oil absorption capacity (OAC) and water
holding capacity (WHC) of the control and treatments were measured. OAC of the three
treatments was not significantly different (P>0.05) from the control. However, WHC of
the formula containing 1.0% PDMG-0093 powder was not significantly different
(P>0.05) from the control. Therefore, 1.0% PDMG-0093 was found to be suitable for
producing a powder-based ready-to-cook formulation for preparing SEVA. Proximate
composition and water activity of the formula containing 1.0% PDMG-0093 powder was
analyzed. Moisture, crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber and total ash percentages of 8.48
± 0.02, 34.7 ± 0.66, 17.79 ± 0.44, 1.02 ± 0.09 and 6.99 ± 0.18, respectively, and water
activity of 0.707 ± 0.002 (22 oC) were evident.

Fish sauce is an amber-coloured liquid condiment made from fish or fish by-products.
Canthidermis maculata is an underutilized fish species with low dressing percentage and
poor sensory attributes. This study aimed to identify the suitability of Canthidermis
maculata for fish sauce production. Fish sauce was produced with low amount of salt and
selected plant-based exogenous enzymes fermentation. Three different treatments with
crude papaya fruit extract (T1), crude pineapple fruit extract (T2), moringa bark extract
(T3), and the control (C) with three replicates were maintained. Deskinned, eviscerated,
washed and minced fish was added with 8% of salt and 15% of crude plant extracts (for
the control 15% distilled water was used). The contents were air-tightly packed in
sterilized glass bottles and incubated at 50 °C for 6 weeks. The produced fish sauces were
evaluated for their yield, proximate composition, sensory attributes, and microbiological
analysis. Results revealed that, the yield of crude papaya and crude pineapple-treated
samples were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than the other two groups. The sensory
evaluation revealed that the crude pineapple extract-treated fish sauce was significantly
(P&lt;0.05) more preferred than other groups of sauces and the commercial product by the
panelists. The microbial analysis revealed no significant (P>0.05) differences among the
treatments and the control. The crude protein content of the pineapple extract-treated
sample was 11.52±0.21which was (P&lt;0.05) higher than the other three groups and it
fulfilled the standards of a fish sauce. Moisture, crude protein, crude fat, ash, and NaCl
contents of T2 sample was 68.16±0.27%, 11.52±0.21%, 0.36±0.10%, 6.60±0.81%,
5.27±0.17%, respectively. Based on the findings it can be concluded that Canthidermis
maculata can be successfully utilized with 15% pineapple crude extract for accelerated
fish sauce production with high yield, sensory attributes and nutritional values as a value-
added product.

Virgin coconut oil (VCO) extracted from coconut kernel is a natural edible product rich
in medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals. This study
was carried out to explore the use of fractionation method to develop a fat spread using
VCO. It was possible to produce a solid fraction from VCO through slow cooling termed
winterization. VCO samples were maintained at different temperatures (19- 21 °C), and
resulting solid fractions were collected at different time intervals. The yield of oil fraction
removed was calculated, and the physicochemical properties of the solid fractions and
liquid fractions were determined. The yield of the liquid fraction decreased with time at
any given temperature, indicating increasing crystal growth with time. Solid fraction of
VCO at 19 °C for 30 min was identified as the most suitable fraction for the development
of the fat spread. Solid fraction recovered at 19 °C for 30 min has the second lowest
iodine value (1.60  0.04) and the highest yield percentage (72.02%  0.67) compared to
other fractions. Four formulations of fat spreads were developed, and physicochemical
properties were determined. A seven-point hedonic test was conducted to evaluate the
appearance, colour, aroma, flavour, spreadability, mouth feel and overall acceptability of
developed fat spreads, and there was a significant difference (P&lt;0.05) in consumer
preference regarding color and the spreadability. Formulation which contained solid
fraction of VCO to coconut flour weight ratio of 18:1 (w/w) was identified as the most
suitable one for the further development.

Instant noodles are a popular food in many parts of the world. However, most of the
instant noodles commercially available are nutritionally not balanced. The aim of this
study was to improve the nutritional composition of instant noodles by incorporating fish
powder as a protein, vitamin and mineral source, and to evaluate its physicochemical and
sensory properties. Different formulations of instant noodles were prepared with wheat
flour and 0, 10, 15 and 20% of fish powder from four fish species, such as, Indian anchovy
(Stolephorus indicus), kelee shad (Hilsa kelee), milk shark (Rhizoprionodon acutus) and
sea chicken (Balistoides viridescens). Cooking properties (optimum cooking time, cook
loss, cooking yield, swelling index and water absorption index) among fish powder
incorporated noodles were not significantly (P>0.05) different. Therefore, 15% fish
powder incorporated formulations were selected based on the cost factors and nutritional
quality to study textural (hardness, adhesiveness, elastic recovery and firmness) and
sensory properties. Among the 4-types of fish powder (15%) incorporated instant
noodles, titan triggerfish and milk shark fish powder incorporated noodles had the highest
consumer preference. Incorporation of fish powder did not significantly (P>0.05) affect
the cooking or textural parameters of the noodles. Milk shark fish powder (15%) and sea
chicken fish powder (15%) could increase protein content in noodles up to 26.10% and
27.40% respectively. According to this study, it can be concluded that milk shark and sea
chicken fish powders can be successfully incorporated into instant noodles to improve its
nutritional and sensory qualities.

Gelatin is a commonly used stabilizer in the processed food industry. Due to the current
economic crisis in the country, importation of number of food additives have been
restricted and there is a timely requirement to identify locally available alternative
ingredients to replace them. Based on the properties of Kithul flour, it can be considered
as a local alternative for gelatin. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the
potential of kithul flour as a substitute for gelatin in processing set yoghurt. Initially,
kithul flour was modified in order to enhance its gelatinization properties. After
modification, set yoghurts were prepared by incorporating modified kithul flour at
varying percentages. Sensory evaluation was carried out with 21 trained panelists to
compare the formulated yoghurts with 5 competitive products available in the market
processed with gelatin. The sensory evaluation revealed that kithul flour incorporation
had a significant (P˂0.05) effect on the preference for aroma, appearance, color, taste,
texture and overall acceptability. The appearance and the texture of kithul flour
incorporated set yoghurt were not preferred. However, aroma, color and taste were highly
preferred. Shelf-life of the yoghurt samples were evaluated by recording the pH for thirty
days of refrigerated storage at seven-day intervals. Recorded pH revealed that it has an
acceptable shelf-life. A sensory evaluation results revealed that there was no significant
(P˃0.05) difference for aroma and color of the yoghurt samples tested during the storage
period.

Xylanase enzyme is used to enhance the end product quality by giving fluffy and
voluminous loaves of bread with soft and elastic properties with a small dosage.
Therefore, testing the effect of xylanase is worth as a cost effective, suitable replacement
for added gluten. The control sample was developed as closely to commercially available
‘paralupaan’. The preliminary tests were done to prepare the control sample and
identified the best bread formulation. The added gluten percentage was 3% of the dough
in the control sample and it was reduced to 1.5% and 0% with added xylanase enzyme.
Two series of formulations were prepared for each 1.5% and 0% gluten with 0, 30, 90,
and 150mg/kg of xylanase enzyme. The physical parameters such as specific volume,
density, height to width ratio of central slice, dough to bread weight ratio, hardness of the
bread and the L*a*b* colour values of the crumb and crust of the bread were measured
and the data were statistically analyzed. According to the physical parameters, 150 mg/kg
xylanase with 1.5% gluten added sample and 150 mg/kg xylanase with 0% gluten added
sample had comparable properties to the control sample and hence they were selected for
the sensory analysis. Sensory analysis of these two formulations and control sample
revealed that the 1.5% gluten and 150 mg/kg xylanase added bread was preferred over
0% gluten and 150 mg/kg xylanase added bread. The proximate analysis showed that
carbohydrate content was decreased and crude fibre content was increased significantly
(P&lt;0.05) when the added gluten in the high-fibre bread was reduced by 50% and
150mg/kg xylanase was incorporated. This study showed that incorporation of xylanase
enzyme has a potential to replace added gluten in high-fibre bread.

Jelly products are popular among the consumers of all ages as a dessert. Gelatin is the
main ingredient in jelly products. Currently, there is a higher demand for vegan jelly
products than gelatin based jelly products. This research was to develop a vegan jelly
dessert as a powder mix using carrageenan and Clitoria ternatea (blue butterfly pea)
flower powder. C. ternatea is grown naturally and a potential colourant in food
preparations. It is a plant with great medicinal value. Carrageenan is a polysaccharide
extracted from certain species of red seaweeds. The compound is widely used for the
structure forming functions in foods. C. ternatea flower petals were cleaned, dried,
ground and sieved to powder preparation. Carrageenan 3.5% to 3.75%, with and without
CaCl2 and citric acid 0.7% to 0.95% and flavouring agent 0.35% to 0.6% were used in
16 treatments and experimented to develop the jelly powder mix. The most acceptable
treatment for jelly was selected using ranking test and Hedonic test (7-points). Texture,
proximate composition, pH, titratable acidity, colour, were determined for the selected
final product. Final product was possessed significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) consumer
preference for taste, flavour and overall acceptability. Proximate composition was 2.4%
moisture, 0.48% Ash, 0.94% protein and 3.3% of fat. Final jelly product consist of
83.34% water, 0.60% gelling agent, 0.12% citric acid, 0.04% CaCl2, 15.70% sugar,
0.08% flavor and 0.12% C. ternatea flower powder. pH and titratable acidity were 4.1and
0.12% respectively. The best formulation of dry jelly powder mix was 3.6 % carrageenan,
0.25% CaCl2, 0.7% citric acid, 94.25% sugar, 0.6% nature identical blackcurrant flavor
and 0.7% C. ternatea flower powder.

Rice is the staple food and the main energy source in most Asian countries, including Sri
Lanka. Modern people are having hectic daily schedules and do not spend much time
preparing their food. This accelerated pace of modern life has promoted new quick-cook
type rice products, which can rehydrate or thaw within a few minutes. This research was
conducted to develop instant fried rice which could be stored under frozen conditions (-
18 °C) and a suitable seasoning powder mixture to incorporate into fried rice by using
powdered leaves of Moringa oleifera and oyster mushrooms as the main ingredients.
Moringa leaf powder incorporated (1.92%) 15 g of seasoning powder was added to 250
g of rice. The amounts of added constituents were determined based on sensory data,
which was determined using a 9-point hedonic test involving 50 untrained panelists.
Determination of a suitable cooking procedure for Bg 360 (Keeri samba) was done using
an electric rice cooker, an electric multi-cooker and the steaming procedure by mainly
considering cooking yield and cooking in the rice cooker was selected. The prepared fried
rice was vacuum packed and stored at three different temperatures (4 °C, 12 °C and 25
°C) for the prediction of the shelf life using the accelerated shelf life test with an
Arrhenius model. The moisture content varied between 62 - 67%, and there was no
significant difference in color (P ˂ 0.05). According to the acid value, the shelf life was
29 days, and according to the peroxide value, the shelf life was 36 days. After 30 days of
frozen storage total plate count was measured upon thawing using, the microwave oven
(74 °C), boiling water (≤100 °C) and steaming (100 °C) and the product was acceptable
for consumption. The new product developed has a potential to be marketed.

In the current Sri Lankan context, about 6.7 million people do not consume an adequate
diet while 5.3 million people have reduced the number of meals partake during the day.
Further, more than 60% of families are eating less, cheaper, and less nutritious food. The
introduction of indigenous and convenient foods with better nutritional quality such as
kola kenda will support ensuring food security among the rural population. The aim of
this study was to develop an instant kola kenda mixture composed of curry leaves
(Murraya koenigii), gotu kola (Centella asiatica), drumstick leaves (Moringa oleifera
L.), mung bean flour, and unripe banana flour and characterize the physicochemical,
nutritional and sensory attributes of the developed kola kenda mixture. The appropriate
proportions of leaf powders and flours were determined by preliminary trials.
Accordingly, 5 different product formulations were prepared. The best formulation was
selected based on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics. Physical properties
did not show any significant difference among formulations. However, higher total
phenolic content [87.98±2.75 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram of sample in
dry weight (mg/g)] and significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) overall preference in the sensory
analysis was observed for the formulation which contains gotu kola 4.0%, curry leaves
1.5%, drumstick leaves 1.5%, coconut flour 28.5%, mung bean flour 21.4%, banana flour
21.4%, garlic powder 7.0%, ginger powder 5.0%, and salt 8.5%. The nutritional quality
of the selected formulation was analyzed using the Association of Official Analytical
Chemists (AOAC) methods and it resulted, crude protein 16.0%, crude fat 0.5%, ash
4.3%, moisture 9.4%, crude fiber 4.8%, and carbohydrates 65.0%.This study revealed
that the developed instant kola kenda mixture has the potential to be used as a convenient
food source to aid ensuring food security among Sri Lankan communities.

Currently, Sri Lankan food industry is engaged in developing alternatives for high
demanding processed food, of which many raw materials are imported. The purpose of
this study was to develop a cost-effective chocolate spread with alternative ingredients
and to evaluate its physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory properties. As
alternative ingredients, peanuts, soybeans, and sweet potatoes were separately used as the
base raw material to formulate different chocolate spreads. At the initial screening,
peanut-incorporated chocolate spread was selected through a sensory testing as the most
preferred formulation. Subsequently, several formulations of peanut-incorporated
chocolate spreads were made with varying amounts of sugar and cocoa powder. The
highest preferred formulation with 35.41% sugar and 10.62% cocoa powder was
analyzed for its physicochemical properties, proximate composition, and microbial
qualities. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and pH of the formulation were 71.73
ºBrix, 0.18, and 5.97, respectively. The develop chocolate spread had a moisture content
of 31.65%, ash content of 3.91%, crude protein content of 16.55%, fat content of 13.81%,
carbohydrate content of 31.37%and fiber content of 2.71%. After pasteurization, the
spread had a significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower levels of total plate count and yeasts and molds
in the accepted range. This study describes that incorporation of peanut as an alternative
base ingredient in developing chocolate spreads is a cost-effective approach due to
utilization of locally available raw materials.

Jaadi is a traditional fermented fish product which is native to Sri Lanka. This product is
popular in Southern part of the country and people used to consume it as a side dish or a
condiment. The liquid component of jaadi is known as Lunijja and it is a rich source of
amino acids and has a strong flavor preferred by the consumers. People use their
traditional knowledge to produce jaadi and processing practices are vary in different
areas. In this study Masked Triggerfish (Sufflamen fraenatum) was used for jaadi
preparation as it was one of the abundantly available fish varieties in Sri Lanka, which
has less market demand as fresh fish. The treatments were planned with the objective of
finding the most suitable formulation and the most suitable fermentation vat in terms of
sensory, microbial and chemical properties. The treatments to find the best formulation
were planned with some variations to the originally used recipe (Fish 1 Kg: Salt 500 g:
Garcinia 100 g). Four different types of vats (glass, clay, wooden and plastic) were used
as the treatments in order to find the most suitable vat while keeping the recipe a constant
(traditional recipe). The highest scored treatment as per the results of sensory evaluation
was combination of 500 g of salt with 100 g of garcinia per 1 kg of fish slices and the
highest preference was obtained by the wooden vat. The Total Volatile Base Nitrogen
(TVB-N) level was impacted by the different formulations (p&lt;0.05) and the titratable
acidity was impacted by the type of vat (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, jaadi with higher sensory
perception can be prepared using Masked Triggerfish using the formula of 500 g of salt
and 100 g of garcinia per 1 Kg of fish in wooden vats made out of Halmilla wood.

This study was conducted to evaluate the potential use of seaweed phycocolloids as
stabilizers in gelatin-free set yoghurt. Three seaweed phycocolloids namely carrageenan,
alginate, and agar-agar were extracted from Kappaphycus alvarazii, Sargassum wightii
and Gracilaria Salicornia, respectively. Preliminary trials were conducted to select the
best incorporation levels of phycocolloids in yoghurt, and the selected levels were 0.12%
(w/v) carrageenan, 0.2% (w/v) alginate and 0.3% (w/v) agar-agar. These levels were
selected based on the syneresis percentage. The hardness, color, proximate composition,
and sensory properties of yoghurt containing selected levels of phycocolloids were
assessed in comparison with a yoghurt containing gelatin (0.8% w/v). All the
phycocolloids incorporated yoghurt showed lower hardness and yellowness than gelatin
yoghurt. Carrageenan yoghurt had significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher protein and fat contents
than gelatin yoghurt. Alginate yoghurt showed similar protein content as gelatin yoghurt
but had a significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower fat content. Incorporation of agar-agar
significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased protein content and increased fat content. The alginate
incorporated yoghurt scored high for overall acceptability. The yoghurts were stored at a
refrigerated temperature (4 ℃) for 14 days and physicochemical parameters (pH,
titratable acidity, syneresis) were analyzed on days 1, 7 and 14. There was no significant
(P>0.05) difference in pH among treatments during storage period. Alginate yoghurt
showed significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower acidity on days 1, 7 and 14 than gelatin yoghurt. All
phycocolloids incorporated yoghurt had significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher syneresis
throughout the storage period. There was no significant (P>0.05) difference in lactic acid
bacteria count in yoghurt on day 1 while their count in phycocolloids incorporated
yoghurt was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher on days 7 and 14. This study revealed that
agar-agar, carrageenan, alginate from seaweeds can be used as stabilizers in set yoghurt,
and incorporation of 0.2% alginate can even improve the sensory properties of yoghurt.

The study was conducted to investigate the effect of the physicochemical,
microbiological and sensory attributes of Lavulu (Pouteria campechiana) pulp
incorporated in drinking yoghurt. Milk was heated up to 70°C then sugar and gelatin were
added. The mixture was pasteurized up to 90- 95°C/3 minutes and pulp was incorporated
in three proportions as 6%, 8% and 10% w/v in last 30 seconds of the pasteurization.
Mixture was cooled up to 44 °C and starter culture (Delvo FVV 211) was added. Then
incubated at 44°C until pH reached 5.0 and kept overnight at 4°C. Curdle was broken by
agitating the mixture. A control was prepared with all ingredients except Lavulu pulp.
One-way ANOVA was used to interpret the results of analysis. There is no significant
difference (p>0.05) in pH value and titratable acidity between control and pulp added
samples throughout the storage up to 10th day. There are significant differences (p&lt;0.05)
in between pulp added and control samples in TS, Fat, Protein and DM content. The
sensory evaluation indicated, pulp added drinking yogurt samples were significantly
better than control samples. The sensory attributes such as color, aroma, taste, and overall
acceptability in pulp added yogurt obtained higher scores compared to the control.
Throughout the storage period there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in yeast and
mold count in between two drinking yoghurts. However, both the yeast and mold counts
increased toward the tenth day of storage in refrigerator. Lavulu gives natural color and
pleasant baked taste to the drinking yogurt. Overall results suggest that adding of Lavulu
fruit pulp in 10% w/v is more effective and improves sensory attributes of drinking
yoghurt.

Cookies are ready to bake snacks made by baking dough that contains flour, fat, sugar,
salt, and leavening agents. Cookies have a soft and tender texture than other biscuit
products due to its high fat content. Readily digestible starch and sugars available in
cookies can cause sudden increase of blood sugar levels. Substitution of wheat flour with
a dietary fiber source or resistant starch source will help to counter negative health
effects. Therefore, this study was aimed to develop a cookie with coconut flour and unripe
banana flour which is more nutritious. Coconut flour showed higher oil absorption
capacity (1.22 ± 0.10 g/g) and water absorption capacity (3.36 ± 0.05 g/g) while wheat
flour showed the lowest values. Two sets of cookies were prepared using unripe banana
flour (UBF) and coconut flour (CF) substituting wheat flour in levels of 10, 20, and 30%.
The 10% substitution was chosen after statistically analysing and comparing the results
of hardness, colour, spread ratio, moisture content, and weight with the control.
Substitution of UBF and CF increased the hardness and reduced the spread ratio.
Composite flour mixtures were prepared by mixing UBF and CF in different percentages.
Cookies with composite flour: 75% UBF and 25% CF (75B25C) was selected as the best
formulation after statistically analysing and comparing the results of physical parameters
of the cookies with the control. Cookies containing CF and 75B25C showed significantly
higher (P&lt;0.05) crude fibre content compared to the control sample. In sensory
evaluation, cookies with CF showed highest scores in appearance, odour, texture, and
flavour parameters while 75B25C showed lowest scores in appearance, texture, flavour,
and overall acceptability. This study showed that there is a potential to develop consumer
acceptable, nutritious cookies by substituting 10% of wheat flour with CF and UBF.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential to enrich black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia
illucens: BSFL) with omega-3 fatty acids by feeding omega-3 rich ingredients: yellowfin
tuna (Thunnus albacares) offal and 3 seaweeds (Kappaphycus alvarezii, Gracilaria
salicornia and Sargassum wightii). Eight substrates were prepared using poultry manure
as basal ingredient: a substrate containing 100% poultry manure (control), 4 substrates
supplemented with 12% of one of the 4 omega-3 rich ingredients (fish offal, K. alvarezii,
G. salicornia or S. wightii) and 3 substrates supplemented with 6% fish offal and 6% of
one of the 3 seaweeds. A total of 5 days-old 3600 BSFL were randomly distributed into
24 plastic containers (150 larvae per container) and fed with one of the 8 substrates for
14 days (n=3). At the end of the experiment, weights of larvae were recorded. Fatty acid
compositions of substrates and BSFL were measured. Omega-3 fatty acid (C20:5 EPA
and C22:6 DHA) contents were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in the BSFL fed 12% fish
offal. K. alvarezii and G. Salicornia also showed similar results, but only when fed
together with fish offal. Further, the results showed a significant (P&lt;0.05) positive
correlation between omega-3 contents in the substrate and BSFL. On the other hand,
supplementation of S. wightii did not enrich BSFL with omega-3 fatty acids. The BSFL
fed 12% fish offal had significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher growth performance and
bioconversion efficiency than the control group. The supplementation of fish offal in
combination with K. alvarezii or G. salicornia did not compromise growth performance
and bioconversion efficiency of BSFL. In conclusion, supplementation of poultry manure
with fish offal and seaweeds (K. alverazii and G. salicornia) can enrich BSFL with
omega-3 fatty acids without compromising larval performance.

Jackfruit is a commonly consumed fruit in Sri Lanka and has a high percentage of
postharvest loss during the season. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of
producing jackfruit bulb flour (JBF) and jackfruit seed flour (JSF) based noodles in order
to reduce the high postharvest loss and develop some value-added products from
jackfruit. Five samples were prepared using the composite flour mixture by mixing the
refined wheat flour (WF), JBF and JSF in different ratios of 50:10:40, 50:20:30, 50:25:25,
50:30:20, 50:40:10 and the control sample by using 100% WF. Cooking characteristics
of the noodle samples were analyzed with respect to cooking time, cooking loss and water
absorption. Physicochemical characteristics such as bulk density, swelling index, yield
ratio, color, adhesiveness, firmness, elastic recovery, hardness, moisture content and ash
content were analyzed using some developed methods. There was no significant
difference among all the developed jackfruit noodles samples for yield ratio (F5,6=0.92,
df=11, P>0.05), firmness (F5,12=2.20, df=17, P>0.05) and elastic recovery (F5,12=0.57,
df=17, P>0.05). Sample prepared from flour ratio of 50:40:10 (WF: JBF: JSF) showed
the lowest cooking loss (6.37 ± 0.55%) and highest swelling index (1.77 ± 0.17). Sample
prepared from flour ratio of 50:25:25 showed the highest cooking time (10.05 ± 0.00 min)
and the highest water absorption (134.67 ± 9.87%) values. Noodles samples prepared
from flour ratio of 50:20:30 showed the highest bulk density (0.26 ± 0.01 g/cm3) and
yield ratio (1.13 ± 0.01). The control sample showed the highest firmness (89.47 ± 0.95%)
and highest elastic recovery (56.95 ± 4.32%) values than the other samples. According
to the sensory evaluation data, noodles sample prepared from flour ratio of 50:10:40
showed the highest preference and the noodles samples of 50:40:10 showed the least
preference.

A solution's impact on a cell's volume is correlated with its tonicity. Isotonic solutions
are those that do not alter the volume of a cell when ingested. Since dehydration impairs
athletic performance and raises the risk of injury, lost fluid during physical activity has
to be replaced as quickly as possible with required levels of energy and electrolytes. For
this replacement, an isotonic beverage is ideal, because it can be directly absorbed to the
body within a short period of time. However isotonic sports beverages have requirements
to be met in the carbohydrate and electrolyte concentrations. This research aims to
develop commercially viable and economically feasible two formulations of isotonic
drinks using synthetic ingredients and natural ingredients with functional attributes.
Study was conducted in two phases as preliminary trial and final trial for each synthetic
formula and natural formulas. Samples from preliminary test were tested for the
osmolality to figure out the final treatments of sensory evaluation. Data was analyzed
through SPSS software. Preferred final samples were analyzed for their mineral content
and physicochemical characteristics. Final formulas were in the required ranges of
osmolality (270-330 mOsm/kg) and sodium content (460 - 1150 mg/L) it to be an isotonic
beverage according to the international regulations. Synthetic sample contains an
osmolality of 284 ± 1 mOsmol/kg and sodium content of 688.2  17.7 mg/L.
Additionally, natural formula with artificial sweetener and 100% natural formula
contains an osmolality and sodium content in the ranges of 307  11 mOsmol/kg, 716.6
 5.8 mg/L, respectively. As conclusions, developed formulas adhere to the requirements
of an isotonic beverage, which could enhance the performance of dehydrated athletes.
There is a high potential to use coconut water and bee honey in Sri Lanka, as rich mineral
and energy sources to formulate isotonic beverages.

Deep-fat frying is one of the most often used methods for preparing and producing foods
worldwide. In the catering industry, repeated heating of oil is done up to a certain level
while achieving the customer safety and profit margins. If the level is exceeded oil quality
becomes undesirable and rancidity can be developed. To ensure the safe margin of frying
oil, various test kits are used in the catering industry. However, these test kits are less
affordable as they are very expensive. In this study, an economically feasible test kit and
a mobile application were developed based on image analysis to determine the rancidity
levels of frying oil. The study was done by two methods (direct and chemical). In the
direct method, total polar materials (TPM %) of the samples were determined by Vito oil
tester and colour analysis was done by a digital colourimeter. There were strong positive
correlations among the TPM (%), L* a* b* values and acid values which were above
0.90 linear regression (R²). The chemical method was developed as an advanced version
of the direct method and used a chemical solution which is sensitive to the free fatty acid
percentage in frying oil. The Mobile application was developed using the React Native
software. It was compatible with the android operating system. The mobile application
was validated using randomly selected oil samples and TPM (%) values were determined
by both mobile application and Vito oil tester. Results were analyzed using R statistical
software. Based on the results, there was not a significant difference (P˃0.05) between
the TPM (%) values, which were obtained by the mobile application and Vito oil tester.
The results also indicated that the proposed method can be used as an alternative method
to detect the rancidity levels of frying oil with high accuracy.

Jackfruit is an excellent source of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. The
current study was carried out to formulate a veggie finger using jackfruit and to identify
the effect of microbial transglutaminase (MTG) on its quality. The preliminary studies
revealed that 25% of jackfruit is the optimum level to be incorporated into veggie fingers.
Three formulations (F1, F2 &amp; F3) of veggie fingers were formulated by incorporating
25% of jackfruit. F1 contained 5% kidney bean powder, 10% isolated soy protein (ISP),
and 5% texturized vegetable protein (TVP), F2 contained 5% chickpea flour and 15%
ISP and F3 contained 5% chickpea flour, 5% ISP, 5% oats, and 5% wheat gluten.
According to the sensory evaluation findings, F1 and F2 were selected for further
improvements and, were treated with MTG at levels of 0%, 1%, and 1.5% and were
subjected to sensory evaluation. Selected veggie fingers with the best level of MTG were
subjected to analysis of water holding capacity (WHC), hardness, cooking loss, pH, 2-
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (2-TBARS) value, and proximate composition.
The WHC of F1 (0% MTG), F1+1% MTG, F2 (0% enzyme), and F2+1% MTG were
43.47±0.52%, 46.34±0.48, 43.29±0.83%, 46.26±1.16% respectively. The hardness of
veggie fingers was significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased with the addition of MTG while the
cooking loss was significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased. The pH and 2-TBARS values were
not significantly different (P>0.05) among treatments. F1 with 1% of MTG was selected
as the best formulation based on sensory evaluation and the overall findings. The dry
matter content and the crude protein content of the Jackfruit containing veggie finger
with 1% MTG were 45.61±1.13% and 19.61±0.63% respectively. It can be concluded
that 1% MTG is the most suitable for Jackfruit containing veggie fingers and it can
increase the WHC, and hardness while reducing the cooking loss.

This study examined the effects of dietary rice polish storage time on broiler chicken
growth performance and meat quality. Ninety-six male, Cobb 500, 1-day old chicks were
randomly allotted into 4 treatment groups (n=4 and 6 birds per replicate). The birds were
fed with one of the four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic experimental diets: a
commercial-like control diet (without inclusion of rice polish) and three diets containing
rice polish stored for &lt;24 hours, 1 week or 35 days. Feed consumption was measured
daily, and body weights were measured weekly. After 35 days of feeding period, weights
of the carcass &amp; breast muscle, and the weights &amp; lengths of the digestive tract organs
were measured. The ileal contents of 16 birds (1 from each replicate) were collected.
Breast muscle was stored at 4 C until the analysis of meat quality characteristics. The
birds fed diets containing rice polish stored for 1 week and 35 days showed significantly
(P&lt;0.05) lower live weight, weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio than the
birds fed control diet. The birds fed rice polish stored for &lt;24 hours showed no difference
in growth performance with the control birds. Feeding rice polish stored for 1 week and
35 days also significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased ileal fat digestibility and significantly
(P&lt;0.05) increased relative digestive tract organ weights and lengths. Furthermore, these
birds showed significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher TBARS (2-thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances) values in meat than the birds fed control diet. There were no significant
differences in other meat quality characteristics (cooking loss, drip loss, water holding
capacity, pH and color) and ileal protein digestibility among the dietary groups. In
conclusion, dietary inclusion of rice polish stored for extended time periods (over 1 week)
can negatively affect the growth performance and meat TBARS values in broiler chicken.

The essential oils were found to be a good alternative to synthetic fungicides due to their
vast spectrum of antifungal compounds present. Since most of them are volatiles, in vitro
study of its effect on selected plant pathogens is beneficial to future in situ applications.
The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro vapor phase effect of selected 3 plant leaf
essential oils (PLEO) against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides which is the known causal
fungal species for papaya anthracnose. The C. gloeosporioides was isolated from infected
papaya fruits and after identification of fungal colonies, their spore morphologies were
further identified using an optical light microscope. The pathogenicity was tested using
koch's postulates method. The 3 PLEO (Cinnamomum verum, Syzygium aromaticum, and
Citrus aurantifolia) were extracted using hydrodistillation method. Mycelium growth
inhibition of C. gloeosporioides by 3 PLEO was evaluated using the modified disc
volatilization method with 3 concentrations (20, 40 and 60 µL per petri plate similar to
0.5, 1 and 1.5 mL per liter). The PLEO extracted from C. verum and S. aromaticum did
not show significant difference (P>0.05) in relation to mycelium growth inhibition
percentage at all 3 concentrations. However, C. aurantifolia PLEO showed significantly
lower (P&lt;0.05) percentage of mycelium growth inhibition than other 2 PLEO at 0.5 mL/L
and 1 mL/L concentrations. However, under highest concentration of 1.5 mL/L, all 3
PLEO treatments did not show significant difference (P>0.05) of mycelium growth
inhibition percentage. Since there were more than 50% inhibitions in both C. verum and
S. aromaticum PLEO at their lowest concentration, these 2 PLEO with 0.5 mL/L can be
equally recommended for in situ applications to reduce papaya anthracnose disease
severity.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of the pre-heat treatment
(breaking) and harvesting stage on the physico-chemical quality attributes of tomato
paste. Tomato breaking temperatures of 60-65 °C (cold-break) and 80-85 °C (hot-break)
for 2 minutes and harvesting stages of breaker, light red and red was used to prepare
tomato paste. Moreover, tomato pastes developed from “Thilina”, “Bathiya” and “HTH-
3” varieties were also evaluated to understand the varietal effect on physico-chemical
characteristics of tomato paste. Physico-chemical characteristics of quality attributes
such as color (L*, a*, and b* values), pH, titratable acidity (%), viscosity (Pa s-1),
lycopene content (mg kg-1.), moisture content (%), and ash (%) of tomato paste were
evaluated to understand the quality attributes of the different treatments. Breaking
methods had a significant effect (P&lt;0.05) on pH and the lycopene content (P&lt;0.05) of
tomato paste. The pH of the hot-brake tomato paste was higher than cold-break pastes.
The lycopene content of the cold-break tomato pastes was higher than hot-break tomato
paste. Tomato paste processed from harvested red-stage tomatoes showed better retention
in redness and yellowness of tomato paste. The treatments between the tomato-breaking
method and the harvesting stage showed a significant interaction (P&lt;0.05) with the
viscosity of tomato paste. The highest viscosity of 87.75±0.12 Pa s-1 was observed in
treatments combination of the red-stage harvesting and hot-break pastes. The lowest
viscosity of 57.75±0.71 Pa s-1 showed at the red-stage and the cold-break processed
tomato paste. The results of the varietal study showed that the tomato variety also had a
significant effect (P&lt;0.05) on the quality attributes of tomato paste. The findings of this
study showed that the cold-break method is more suitable than the hot-break method for
the processing of tomato paste. Moreover, harvesting tomatoes at red stage can also be
recommended for processing of quality tomato paste.

The health benefits of tea could be improved by processing it into a functional beverage
like kombucha. Traditionally kombucha is produced using a symbiotic culture of bacteria
and yeast. The current study was conducted to determine the potential of using an
improved method for developing a non-alcoholic kombucha product. New kombucha
was developed with selected Ceylon tea using Lactobacillus plantarum freeze-dried
culture, with a nutrient substrate, and sugar. A range of kombucha was developed using
Ceylon black tea high-grown (BTHG), black tea low-grown (BTLG), green tea (GT), and
herbal tea (Ginger, moringa, rampe, and lemongrass). Preliminary trials were conducted
to identify the correct formulation and process conditions with the best sensory profile
for the modified method of kombucha production. All samples and 2 market available
Kombucha samples (controls) were analyzed for pH (an electronic pH meter), total
titratable acidity (potentiometric titration), total soluble solids (TSS; refractometer),
alcohol (ebulliometer), and color parameters (colorimeter). The sensory properties (color,
aroma, sweetness, mouthfeel, sourness, and overall acceptability) of kombucha were
evaluated using a 7-point hedonic scale with 30 semi-trained panelists. BTHG - dust,
BTLG- pekoe, GT- gun powder one (GP1), and lemongrass had the highest acidity
among each tea type (range 0.24 - 0.51% w/v lactic acid). The market kombucha samples
had significantly lower (P&lt;0.005) TSS (range 3.90 - 4.20 ºBrix) compared to all
developed samples. BTHG-Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe, BTLG-dust, GT-GP1,
moringa, and lemongrass teas had the highest Brix values (range 5.00-5.90 ºBrix). No
alcohol was detected in the developed kombucha samples. BTHG and BTLG-Broken
Orange Pekoe, GT-Sencha, and Ginger kombucha had the highest preference based on
overall acceptability. Future studies should focus on the changes in the major chemical
components of kombucha during the fermentation process and the functional properties
of the product developed with this modified method.

Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) or ‘Ahu’ has been used for years in traditional medicine. Its
juice has become one of the most popular fruit juices in the global market as a wellness
drink due to its health benefits. As noni fruit is not utilized by the food industry in Sri
Lanka, this study focused on determining bioactives and functional properties of ripe fruit
(methanolic and water) and simulated gastrointestinal digesta fractions. Methanol (80%)
showed higher extractability of bioactives than water. Moreover, antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory properties were higher, and anti-diabetic properties were lower in
methanolic extracts than that in water extracts. The total phenolic content (TPC) of 198.6
± 1.7 μmol gallic acid equivalent/g FW, and ascorbic acid, anthocyanin and β-carotene
contents of 53.01 ± 0.59, 57.33 ± 0.96 and 0.27 ± 0.02 μg/g FW, respectively were evident
in the fresh fruit. DPPH and ABTS radicals scavenging percentages of the fresh fruit
were 97.09 and 98.98, respectively. The total antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit was
33.94 mg AAE/g FW. Singlet oxygen and NO scavenging abilities of the fresh fruit were
above 90%. Percentages of heat-induced hemolysis, protein denaturation inhibition and
proteinase inhibitory activities of the fresh fruit were 37.14, 42.32 and 5.23, respectively
at 2 µg/mL. Furthermore, alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of
the fresh fruit were 13.7 and 17.0%, respectively at 2 µg/mL. Content of bioactives, and
antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities of dialysable fractions were
significantly lower (P&lt;0.05) than their originals. Positive correlations between TPC and
antioxidant activities, and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities were evident. As
the results of this study revealed presence of bioavailable bioactive compounds
possessing antioxidant, anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activities in the fruit, it would
beneficial for the food industry and consumers, if noni fruit incorporated food products
possessing appealing sensory attributes could be developed.

Yoghurt is a widely consumed, most popular fermented dairy product in Sri Lanka which
has numerous health benefits. The demand for yoghurt is increasing day by day acquiring
a higher proportion of the overall dairy market. As a result, a number of yoghurt
manufacturers emerge throughout the country. But there is a lack of data on physico-
chemical quality characteristics of yoghurt and yoghurt drinks available in the market.
Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate the physico-chemical quality of yoghurt and
yoghurt drinks with respect to the SLS 824:2018 standard. Eighteen yoghurt brands were
purchased from retail shops and supermarkets considering an equal number of set-
yoghurt and yoghurt drink brands. Physico-chemical quality characteristics such as fat
(%), protein (%), milk solids non-fat (MSNF %), total sugars (%), and preservatives were
analyzed and added synthetic colors were also identified. According to the results, fifteen
brands were complying with the standard but three brands did not comply with the
minimum requirement of the fat content. Specifications laid down in the standard for
protein, MSNF, total sugars, and sorbic acid were fulfilled by the all selected yoghurt
brands. But several brands did not comply with the maximum value specified in the
standard for benzoic acid which is not permitted to use in yoghurt as a food preservative.
Tartrazine was detected as a synthetic color only in three selected yoghurt brands. It is
observed that large-scale, well-known yoghurt manufacturers mostly produce their
products complying with the specifications in the standard. Many quality defects were
identified in small-scale, regional yoghurt brands. Therefore, it is suggested to improve
the knowledge of small-scale manufacturers in order to improve the quality of the
products up to the SLS standard.

Plants with edible underground organs are considered root and tuber crops. Although
many varieties are grown in Sri Lanka, most are considered underutilized crops.
Underutilized root and tuber flours and starches can be used in the food industry as a
carbohydrate source as well as functional food ingredients. This study was conducted to
characterize the flours and starches of Buthsarana (Canna indica), Raja ala (Dioscorea
alata), Hulankiriya (Maranta arundinacea) and Kiri ala (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) by
analyzing physicochemical and functional properties. Moisture content (dry basis), bulk
density, yield and colour were determined using standard methods, and amylose content
was determined using the colourimetric method. Centrifugation methods were used in
determination of water holding capacity, oil holding capacity, solubility and swelling
power. Flour colours were different, and D. alata showed a pink colour. Round or oval
shaped starch granules were observed in C. indica and M. arundinacea starches and
round or hemispherical shaped granules in X. sagittifolium. The largest granules were C.
indica and smallest were X. sagittifolium. Moisture content of flours and starches varied
in the range of 9.59 - 11.11% and 10.17 - 11.31%, respectively. There were no significant
differences (P>0.05) between water holding capacities and oil holding capacities of flours
and starches. Although solubility of flours were not significantly different (P>0.05),
starch showed a significant difference (P&lt;0.05) in terms of solubility. The highest yield
and the lowest bulk density were recorded with the X. sagittifolim starch. Amylose
content and swelling power of C. indica starch were significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than
M. arundinacea and X. sagittifolium starches. Selected underutilized flours and starches
have a potential to use in the food industry, as they have physicochemical and functional
properties which are suitable for food applications.

This study aimed to extract, purify and characterize chitosan from crab (Portunus
pelagicus), shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and insect (Hermetia illucens) shells. The
extraction and purification of crab chitosan were done using a previously developed
method consisting of pre-treatment, demineralization, deproteinization, pigment
removal, deacetylation and purification. The extraction and purification of chitosan from
shrimp and insect shells were done with some modifications. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used for the identification of
purified chitosan. Two patterns and the peak positions of XRD were almost similar
between standard chitosan and chitosan purified from 3 species. Vibration of functional
groups of chitosan in the FTIR was comparable with the standard wavelengths of
standard chitosan in literature. Crab (33%) and shrimp (33%) resulted in significantly
higher (P&lt;0.05) chitosan yield than insects (24%). Physico-chemical, antioxidant and
antimicrobial properties of chitosan purified from 3 species were determined in
comparison with standard chitosan. The degree of deacetylation was significantly higher
(P&lt;0.05) in crab and insect chitosan compared to standard chitosan, whereas it was
(P&lt;0.05) lowest in shrimp chitosan. Moisture &amp; ash contents and water &amp; fat binding
capacities were highest (P&lt;0.05) in insects among the three species. Crab and shrimp
chitosan had significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) whiteness index compared to standard and
insect chitosan. According to the DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP
(Ferric ion Reducing Antioxidant Power assay) assays, insect chitosan had a significantly
higher (P&lt;0.05) antioxidant activity than crab, shrimp and standard chitosan. Chitosan
from all the species showed antimicrobial properties against Candida, Staphylococcus,
Pseudomonas and E. coli, except shrimp chitosan which did not show antimicrobial
activity against Staphylococcus. In conclusion, physico-chemical, antioxidant and
antimicrobial properties of chitosan can vary with the species from which it is extracted.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Almost all dry dog foods available in the Sri Lankan market are imported products and
are comparatively expensive. Due to present import restrictions, the price is unaffordable
to dog owners and the product is unavailable in the local market. This research was
conducted to formulate a palatable dry adult dog food for the local market and to compare
it with the imported brands. Nutritional requirements for the formulation were
determined using the daily nutrient requirement of an adult dog, literature, pet shop
owners, consultation with veterinary practitioners, and an online survey of dog owners.
The dry adult dog food in the form of the nugget was formulated using 14 ingredients.
Crude protein, fat, carbohydrates, energy, and crude fiber were balanced in the
formulation using a linear programming method. The flavour was developed separately
by acid hydrolysis of chicken liver and gizzard. The hydrolysate was filtered and
concentrated. Nuggets were prepared manually, coated with the developed flavour
concentrate followed by drying. Proximate composition, Total Plate count, and yeast and
mold count were determined in the developed product. Palatability tests were conducted
using local cross-breed of 30 adult dogs. Feeding pan choice, preferred nugget colour,
shape, and size, and preference over the market branded products was evaluated. The
developed product contained 23.4% crude protein, 2.3% crude fiber, 49.3% carbohydrate,
9.5% crude fat, 6.0% ash, and 6.5% (dry basis) moisture. The Total Plate Count was 47.62
cfu/g and the yeast and mold count was 28.57 cfu/g Red-coloured, round-shaped large
nuggets were selected as the most preferred nuggets. The preference for the developed
dry dog food was not significantly different (P>0.05) compared to the imported brands.

Yogurt is a fermented dairy product containing probiotics important for digestive health.
Chickpea is a protein and fiber-rich legume with prebiotic effects. Developing a probiotic
yogurt incorporating chickpeas could produce a synbiotic product and can boost gut
bacteria. Therefore, the objective of this study was to formulate a synbiotic concentrated
type of yogurt with chickpea flour and wood apple pulp powder. A preliminary study was
conducted to determine the amount of wood apple powder to be added. Using the selected
wood apple percentage (7.5%), 4 formulations were developed with 0%, 1%, 2.5%, and
5% chickpea flour. The pH, titratable acidity, viscosity, percentage of susceptibility to
syneresis, percentage of water holding capacity, the viability of probiotic organisms, and
sensory attributes of yogurts and the moisture content, crude fiber, ash, crude protein,
and crude fat of formulations were determined. The results demonstrated that chickpea
flour stimulated the growth of lactobacilli after 14 days of storage. The numbers of viable
probiotic bacteria in treatments were in the range of 6.2-7.9 log CFU/mL for lactobacilli
in Rogosa agar media. During refrigerated storage, probiotics maintained a viable count
above the minimum therapeutic level (106 CFU/g) in all yogurt formulas. There was no
significant difference (P>0.05) in the pH and acidity among the treatments. However,
with increasing chickpea flour percentage, the viscosity, water holding capacity, total
solids, ash content, crude protein content, and crude fiber content were increased. There
was no significant difference (P>0.05) in sensory properties comparing plain wood apple
yogurt (0% chickpea flour) with 1%, 2.5%, and 5% chickpea flour added samples.
Therefore, results suggest that a synbiotic concentrated type yogurt could be formulated
by adding up to 5% chickpea flour to enhance protein and fiber content and wood apple
pulp flour without adverse effects on the sensory and physicochemical properties.

Even though chemical preservatives are commonly used in the food industry, some are
proven to cause negative health effects. Therefore, food industry is seeking alternative
natural preservatives. The objective of this study was to evaluate the preservative effect
of garcinia (Garcinia quaesita). Five garcinia treatments; 3 water extracts
(T1:concentrated in dialysis tubing below 60 °C, T2:concentrated in vacuum oven below
60 °C and T3:heat macerated at 100 °C), solvent extract (T4), and powdered garcinia
(T5) were used in this study. Preservative action using antimicrobial activity against
Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus niger, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
strains, antioxidant activity (DPPH assay) and the total phenolic content (TPC) were
assessed. The highest antimicrobial activity was observed in T4 while all water extracts
and garcinia powder showed moderate antimicrobial activity against the microbial
strains. All garcinia treatments showed good antioxidant capacity (60 - 80%). The highest
TPC was observed in T3 (22 mg gallic acid equivalents per mL). The pH of the garcinia
treatments was in the range of 1.7 – 2.55 and all extracts were of shades of red color. A
storage study was conducted incorporating garcinia treatments into tomato sauce and
compared with a sodium benzoate added to tomato sauce as the control. No observable
yeast and mold count was observed in any sample after 4 weeks of storage. Garcinia-
treated tomato sauces had lower pH values compared to the control. The pH reduced over
storage time while there was no significant (p>0.05) change in color or total acids during
the storage. A sensory analysis was conducted using garcinia powder and water extract
incorporated tomato sauce and the control to assess consumer preference. The garcinia-
treated tomato sauce had a similar preference compared to the control. Therefore, garcinia
could be used as an effective natural preservative in food.

Oryza rhizomatis is a perennial rice species with a rhizome, endemic to Sri Lanka, and
consists of very important characteristics. Here, the grain quality characteristics at
maturity, and related genes were analyzed in six accessions of O. rhizomatis, compared
with improved varieties (Bg352 and Bg358) and wild rice species Oryza nivara and
Oryza rufipogon. Physical properties of paddy and brown rice were calculated using
length, width, and length-to-width ratio. Physicochemical properties such as amylose
content (AC), gelatinization temperature (GT), and antioxidant activity (AOA) were also
analyzed. Rice kernel endosperm and starch granule morphology were examined by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Responsible genes of starch properties (GBSSI
and SSIIa) were accessed bioinformatically using existing genomic data. Results
indicated that all the wild rice species have a red pericarp layer, short or medium grain
size, and medium grain shape while the improved varieties have white pericarp, short to
medium size grains, and either bold or medium shapes. According to the SEM images,
the morphology and distribution of the starch granules, the shape of endosperm cells, also
the size and distribution of protein bodies in the kernel of wild species were similar to
the improved rice varieties. However, the existence of pinholes indicated that O.
rhizomatis might possess potential benefits for starch processing while the distinctive
sub-aleurone layer indicates the possibility of high protein content. All samples belonged
to the high AC category in the range of 30.27-34.17% without significant difference
(P>0.05). All O. rhizomatis accessions were high GT category except INRC22 while
others were in either low or intermediate GT category. Additionally, AOA of O.
rhizomatis was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than the improved varieties. According to
the available sequencing data, there were no clear variations in the exons of two genes.
However further analysis is needed for the identification of accession level differences.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
There are three main groups of macroalgae(seaweeds); red, green and brown. Some
macroalgae species are being used in food applications for centuries in certain countries.
Although macroalgae are rich in nutrients, their edible uses are unexploited in Sri Lanka.
The diversity of macroalgae is prominent in Hikkaduwa coastal area. Endophytes are
endosymbiotic organisms with antimicrobial, anticancer and anti-insect properties,
because of their secondary metabolites. These properties are important in food and
pharmaceutical applications. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the edible
macroalgae species in Hikkaduwa coastal area and to isolate the endophytes present in
macroalgae. Algae was collected with the prior approval of Coast Conservation and
Coastal Resource Department and Department of Wildlife Conservation. Collected
macroalgae was identified using fresh specimens, photographs, herbarium specimens and
available literature. Endophytes study was done by culturing them in potato dextrose agar

This research evaluates two new bulk banana packaging methods for long-distance
transport in Sri Lanka. Packaging banana “hands” in plastic crates and banana bunches
in two-story cabins (vertically) were the new bulk packaging methods. Two transports
were done to test the new methods in a long distance transport (130 km) using a medium-
size open truck, in comparison with the conventional horizontal packaging method as the
control treatment. Data were collected at each step in the supply chain. Post-harvest
quality was assessed based on visual quality rating (VQR), ripening index (RI),
mechanical damage percentage, physiological weight loss (PWL), total soluble solids
(TSS), fruit firmness and juice pH. Cost-benefit analysis and consumer preference (at
retailer stage) were evaluated. Based on the VQR, which affects consumer preference,
the shelf life was decided. The new bulk packaging methods showed a 2-day increment
in shelf life. Packing in plastic crates and two-story cabins significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05)
the mechanical damages from 19.6% to 3.2% and 8.7%, respectively. During long-
distance transportation and retailer sale, bulk packaging methods were not significantly
different (p > 0.05) with respect to PWL. The gradual changes found in fruit firmness,
juice pH and TSS from the farmer to consumer level followed a similar pattern for all
three packaging treatments. The plastic crates and two-story cabin increased the profit
margins by 1227% and 74%, respectively, for Embul banana due to the reduction of
postharvest losses. Consumer preference for banana transported under new packaging
methods was mainly determined by their improved appearance. Hence packaging banana
hands in plastic crates as well as bunches vertically in two storied cabins reduced the
mechanical damage while increasing the shelf life, profit margin, and consumer
preference, subjected to variety, Embul, long distance upto 130 km and good road
conditions in a medium scale open truck.

Glycemic stress, oxidative stress and associated inflammatory reactions are the
precursors to atherosclerosis and insulin resistance that lead to cardiovascular diseases
and type-2 diabetes mellitus. This study was conducted to evaluate the in-vitro inhibitory
potential of cinnamon, curry leaves and lemongrass against pancreatic lipase and
pancreatic α-amylase, and to relate their efficacy as dietary therapeutic candidates to
reduce post-prandial hyperglycemia and post-prandial hyperlipidemia. The Selected
plant materials were air dried and their aqueous extracts were freeze dried. Dried extracts
were tested for in-vitro antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic potential, employing
pancreatic lipase and α-amylase inhibition assays. A moderate, but significant (P&lt;0.05)
pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity of 38.81%, 24.52%, 22.16% and α-amylase
inhibitory activity of 15.31%, 39.97%, and 46.05% was observed for lemongrass, curry
leaves and cinnamon extracts respectively. Lemongrass extract had a significantly
(P&lt;0.05) high lipase inhibition compared to the other extracts, and the inhibitory effects
of curry leaves and cinnamon extracts was not significantly (P>0.05) different. However,
all three extracts had a significantly (P&lt;0.05) different α-amylase inhibition, among one
another. According to the findings of this study it can be presumed cinnamon, curry
leaves and lemongrass as potential dietary candidates to reduce the risk of type-2 diabetes
mellitus and atherosclerosis and by reducing post-prandial blood glucose levels and post-
prandial triglyceride levels. However, further studies are required to confirm the
applicability and the efficacy the observed in-vitro activities in human subjects.

Ice-cream consumption has been increasing due to changes in lifestyles and food habits.
Serving ice-cream in cones is one of the most popular modes. As these products are not
considered a healthy part of a regular diet, this study focused on developing an ice cream
cone with added value. Nine formulations containing different proportions of flours such
as cassava (38 to 51%), soybean (20 to 25%), black-gram (10 to 12.5%), cowpea (10 to
12.5%) and green-gram (5.45 to 7.99%) as major ingredients, and sugar (2.5 to 3.45%),
table salt (0.05 to 0.06%) and baking powder (0.5 to 1%) as minor ingredients were the
treatments. Amount of water used in 9 formulations increased from 140 to 160 ml with
increase in the percentages of cassava flour from 51 to 38%. Hardness and water holding
capacity (WHC) of the samples (9 formulations) and of a market sample were measured.
Hardness of the market sample was 5.98 ± 0.01 N, which was not significantly different
(p>0.05) from the formulation containing 45.6, 5.7, 11.4, 11.4 and 22.8% of cassava,
green-gram, cowpea, black-gram, and soybean flours as major ingredients, respectively,
and 2.8, 0.05 and 0.75% of sugar, table salt and baking powder as minor ingredients,
respectively. Lowest WHC of 19.79 ± 1.07 was evident in the same formulation, which
was similar in hardness to the market sample. Therefore, the formulation resulted in
hardness and WHC similar to the market sample was selected as the most suitable
formulation for producing ice-cream cones. Moisture, total ash, crude protein, crude fat,
and crude fiber percentages of the selected formulation were 5.42 ± 0.46, 2.58 ± 0.02,
14.39 ± 0.21, 6.07 ± 0.05 and 4.11 ± 0.09, respectively, and of the water activity was 0.45
± 0.02.

Microplastics in the Gut Contents of Salt-Dried Smoothbelly Sardinella
(Amblygaster leiogaster) from Kalpitiya and Trincomalee, Sri Lanka

Microplastics (MP) are fragments of plastics less than 5mm in size, which may pose a
threat to human health through the ingestion of contaminated food. As MP could
bioaccumulate in the digestive tract and other tissues of marine organisms, it is important
to understand the current status of MP contamination in Sri Lankan seafood. Therefore,
this study assessed the MP in the gut contents of salt-dried smoothbelly sardinella
(Amblygaster leiogaster) produced in Sri Lanka using samples collected from secondary
wholesalers in Kalpitiya and Trincomalee. Two methods of organic digestion; wet
peroxide oxidation (WPO) and alkaline digestion (AD) using 10% KOH, were used to
determine the best-suited method to be used for salt-dried fish. Based on the amount of
MP recovered, the WPO is preferable to AD. Microscopy and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy
were used for the identification and quantification of microplastics. Dried fish samples
from both locations were contaminated with items that are identified as MP. However,
only microfibers (fibers that are less than 5mm in length) were identified in all the
samples. There was a significant difference between the levels of microplastics in
samples from the two locations (P&lt;0.05). Specifically, dried fish from Kalpitiya reported
a significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher amount of MP (12,031.55 ± 5,059 items/kg) with a higher
color variation; black (50%), transparent (14%), white (10%), blue (10%), red (7%),
green (5%), yellow (4%), compared to dried fish from Trincomalee (2,129.41 ± 925
items/kg) which had fewer color variations; black (46%), blue (31%), green (15%), red
(8%). The current study results provide preliminary evidence for the need of
quantification of microplastics assimilated in the edible content of the salt-dried
smoothbelly sardinella in Sri Lanka. As the fish gut is rarely removed during dired fish
production and consumption, these may contribute to the MP ingestion by Sri Lankan
consumers.

Morphological and Molecular Identification of Weeds in Export-Ready
Coir Samples

The coir industry is an export-oriented high-income agro-based business. Sri Lanka is the
world’s largest coir and brown fiber supplier. Coir products contaminated with weeds
have been identified as the main challenge in coir exportation. The National Plant
Quarantine Service (NPQS) of Sri Lanka is the governing agency that regulates the
movement of weeds into and out of the country. Yet, the current tests used in the NPQS
are not sufficient to identify certain weed species. Therefore, this project aimed to
develop a strategy to identify weed contaminants in export-ready coir using DNA
barcoding and morphological characters. Coir samples were subjected to grow-out tests
(as recommended by the NPQS) at the NPQS planthouse from September to November
2022. Standard plastic trays were filled with coir and moisture content was maintained at
85% for 21 days. Then, seedlings (20) that emerged from coir materials were transplanted
in clay pots and a seedling guide was prepared using distinctive morphological
characters. Only seven morphologically distinctive seedlings were identified. Thus, it is
recommended to extend the data collection up to the flowering stage to confirm the
species status of each seedling. DNA was extracted from the 20 seedlings for DNA
barcoding targeting 3 regions; rbcL, matK and trnL-F. DNA sequencing was done for
rbcL for one species and a similarity search was conducted in NCBI BLAST. The species
was identified as Cyperus richardii with a 99.83% identity. Since this species has not
been previously recorded in Sri Lanka, further studies are suggested to confirm the
results. The outcome of the study is highly useful to identify frequent weed contaminants
of coir, to propose strategies to minimize the contamination and issuing phytosanitary
certificates.

The current study was carried out to investigate physicochemical, microbiological, and
sensory attributes of drinking-yoghurt prepared with varying concentrations of Kithul
(Caryota urens) flour (0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.5%). The final products were stored at 4 ºC for
21 days and physicochemical and microbiological properties were evaluated weekly
during the storage. The results of sensory evaluation revealed that treatment containing
0.2% (v/v) Kithul flour had the highest preference. pH values of all yoghurt samples
reduced significantly (p&lt;0.05) during the storage period. Total coliform count, yeast and
mould count were negative in all sample during 21 days of storage at 4 C. Therefore,
the results of the current study suggested that Kithul flour could be successfully utilized
to manufacture drinking-yoghurt with enhanced physicochemical and sensory properties.

Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are in increasing demand as a natural stabiliser in
yoghurt making and could replace or reduce the use of gelatin for many reasons. The
present study investigated the potential for gelatin replacement in set-yoghurt using an
exopolysaccharide-producing YoFlex® Premium 6.0 starter culture (CHR HANSEN,
Horsholm, Denmark). This experiment was carried out for three different fat levels
(0.4%, 1.5%, and 3.0%). Each fat level contained one control sample (with 0.5% gelatin
and conventional culture). Altogether eighteen treatments were prepared using YoFlex®
Premium 6.0 starter culture and six different gelatin levels (0.0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%,
0.4%, 0.5%) for three fat levels. Out of the eighteen treatments, the five best treatments
(P6-A, P5-A, P4-A, P2-A, P1-A) were identified based on the texture and syneresis data
for further evaluation. All those selected five treatments were included in the 0.4% fat
level, and then they were subjected to sensory, texture, titratable acidity, and viscosity
analyses to investigate the potential for gelatin replacement. The highest (P&lt;0.05)
hardness and overall acceptability were observed in the treatment with 0.5% gelatin level.
However, the highest (P&lt;0.05) titratable acidity and viscosity values were observed in
the treatment with 0.0% gelatin level. Therefore, this study concluded that YoFlex®
Premium 6.0 starter culture has good potential to replace gelatin in the set-yoghurt with
0.4% fat level and concluded that gelatin can be replaced completely in the set-yoghurt
with desirable titratable acidity and viscosity attributes. However, desirable sensory and
texture attributes can be obtained in set-yoghurt produced by YoFlex® Premium 6.0
starter culture with 0.5% gelatin level. It is revealed that, in the Sri Lankan context,
YoFlex® Premium 6.0 starter culture may be best suited for stirred-yoghurt rather than
set-yoghurt preparation.

Seed production as planting materials is very important. However, part of those produced
seeds get rejected during seed certification due to poor germination. One possible way of
improving the germination is seed priming. This study was conducted to quantitatively
describe the effects of different priming methods (Halo, Hydro and Osmo) on
germination in accepted and rejected seed lots of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L. var.
Thissa) and sesame (Sesamum indicum L. var. Uma). This experiment was conducted at
the Seed Certification and Plant Protection Center, Gannoruwa during Sept.–Dec., 2022.
Seeds were primed with 2% NaCl (Halo), Distilled water (Hydro) and, 5% Poly Ethylene
Glycol (Osmo) for 16 hours at 25oC. Experiment was arranged as a two-factor factorial
in a completely randomized design with three replicates and the non-primed treatment
was used as the control. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were taken in 10-day
old seedlings under each treatment and were expressed as OJIP curves. Results revealed
that different priming methods had significant effects on germination percentage,
moisture percentage, seedling vigor, the electrical conductivity, and seed micro floral
(Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Bacteria, and Saprophytes)
counts. Halo priming increased the germination percentages, shoot length and seedling
vigor, the electrical conductivity, and moisture percentage of groundnut and sesame
seeds. However, none of the tested priming methods were strong enough to improve the
quality of rejected groundnut seeds. Hydro and Halo priming were good for improving
the seed quality in rejected sesame seeds. All three priming methods were good for
increasing the seedling quality of accepted sesame seeds and they did not affect the seed
germination percentage positively or negatively. Thus, seed priming is beneficial for the
farmer as it increases the germination ability of seeds.

Pimenta dioica (L.) Merill., the allspice plant having the combination of flavours of
clove, cinnamon, cardamon and nutmeg has not been explored in Sri Lanka for its
potential uses. In this study, a process optimization was carried out to extract oleoresin
and essential oil from the first 8 leaf positions of shoots of allspice. Several solvent
mixtures were tested for the extraction of allspice oleoresin. Total antioxidant capacity,
total phenolics and total flavonoids in allspice oleoresin were determined using ferric
reducing antioxidant power assay, modified Folin-Ciocalteu method and a calorimetric
method, respectively. Characterization of essential oil was done using gas
chromatography. Acetone: Hexane (90:10) was identified as the optimum solvent
mixture to extract oleoresin and the highest yield (8.92 ± 0.03%) was obtained from the
7th leaf position. There was no significant (p>0.05) difference in the yield of oleoresin
from the 6th leaf position upwards, the highest yield (4.45 ± 0.10%) of leaf essential oil
was observed in the 3rd leaf position. The highest amount of total antioxidant capacity
(1,555.69 ± 7.04 mg TE/g of oleoresin) and total phenolic content (143.19 ± 2.24 mg
GAE/g of oleoresin) were observed in oleoresin extracted from 2nd leaf position whereas
highest total flavonoids (718.78 ± 25.24 mg RE/g of oleoresin) were recorded in the 5th
leaf position. Eugenol was the most abundant (89.43 ± 0.03% in 7th leaf) chemical in the
leaf essential oil followed by β-caryophyllene (10.92 ± 0.07% in 1st leaf) and Myrcene
(2.21 ± 0.02% in 1st leaf) respectively. The residual solvent level was maintained below
25 mg/kg levels in the final allspice oleoresin product. Two products, allspice herbal
black tea and green tea, from allspice leaves, were developed. The findings of this study
encourage the commercial-scale cultivation of allspice in Sri Lanka.

Growth of vegan food market indicates the desire of consumers for vegan diets. As
modern consumers are health conscious regardless of their busy lifestyles, this study
focused on developing cowpea milk powder and ingini seed powder for possible
incorporation in formulating vegan products. Cowpea seeds were sundried, dehulled and
soaked in 1% NaHCO3 (24 h). Swollen seeds were rinsed, hand-peeled, blanched (95 °C
for 1 minute), cooled and ground with water in 1:3 (w/v). The resultant slurry was filtered
through a muslin cloth, and consistency of the filtrate was adjusted by adding 1 fold of
distilled water, followed by mixing with maltodextrin (3% - w/v). Cowpea milk
containing maltodextrin (CM-MD) was spray dried at an inlet and outlet temperatures of
185 °C and 90 °C respectively, and 35-40 rpm of feed pump rate at 0.6 MPa constant
compressed air pressure. Moisture content (MC) of 3.62 ± 1.09%, bulk density of 0.55
± 0.00 g/mL and particle density of 1.61 ± 0.17 g/mL were evident in spray dried CM-
MD. Ingini seeds were roasted at 200, 220 and 240 oC for 20, 15 and 10 min, respectively,
as treatments in triplicate, ground and sieved (200 µm). Physical properties of roasted
ingini seed powder (RISP) revealed no significant effect (P>0.05) of roasting on MC,
colour and swelling index, and significant effect (P&lt;0.05) on yield and solubility. Among
the three roasting conditions, roasting at 220 °C for 15 min was found to be the most
suitable for obtaining RISP, in which moisture content of 6.66 ± 0.07%, yield of 56.01 ±
6.93%, colour of 89.7 ± 5.4 (lightness), swelling power of 47.94 ± 2.53% and solubility
of 71.7 ± 0.7% were evident. Further research is necessary to find out the suitability of
CM-MD and RISP for formulating plant-based milk alternatives, particularly for vegans.

The quality of instant tea is based on the raw materials, which depend on the tea cultivar,
management practices, climatic conditions, etc. This study aimed to compare the quality
parameters of instant teas produced from BMF obtained after the orthodox manufacturing
process of clone TRI-2025, taken from organically and conventionally managed two
selected tea estates from each elevation category of up-country (UC), mid-country (MC),
and low-country (LC) of Sri Lanka. Total polyphenol content (TPC) using folin-ciocalteu
method (ISO 14502-1), caffeine content using chloroform extraction method, maximum
residue levels (MRL) using AOAC 2015.01 with ICP-MS method, phosphorous and
potassium content, colour, and haze of instant tea were analyzed. A significant difference
was observed for TPC in three elevations where UC showed the highest (25.74%) and
LC showed the lowest (19.27%). The caffeine content in MC (8.2 mg/ L) and LC (8.1
mg/ L) was greater than in UC (6.2 mg/ L). The L value for color, UC recorded 53.51
(lightness) while it was 44.5 (darkness) MC. Higher L gives more clarity whereas a lower
L gives less clarity, therefore, to prepare ice tea like beverages UC tea extract would be
the best. The highest haze value of (232.17 NTU) was detected in UC and the lowest of
(78.10 NTU) in LC, which gives more ‘teaness’ in UC and is good for 3-in-1 sachet pre-
mixtures. No heavy metals (Pb, Cd, As, and Hg) were detected in any of the instant tea
types which confirmed that still Ceylon tea can be demanded at a premium price for its
superior quality. These findings could be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries
to produce value-added products in line with the customer’s preferences and to explore
even better marketing avenues for Ceylon Tea to enhance revenue generation in the
country.

The consumer acceptability and the sensory attributes of flavoured pasteurized milk
products are influenced by the raw milk quality (i.e., fat, and solid not-fat (SNF)
percentages). The current study was designed to evaluate the quality of raw milk received
at the dairy processing plant and to determine whether there is an impact of added
skimmed milk powder (SMP) on the sensory attributes of the finished product. The plant
used milk from 8 collecting centers to produce pasteurized milk products. The fat%
(Gerber method), SNF%, and keeping quality (Resazurin test method) of raw milk
received from each center were analyzed to identify significant variation within a center
with time and between centers. Sensory analysis was conducted to identify consumer
preference for the milk samples (3 flavours: vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate) based on
the amount of SMP added. The results indicated that within each center there was a slight
variation in the initial fat%, SNF% and keeping quality. However, this was not
statistically significant (P>0.05). The pairwise comparison between centers indicated that
there were significant differences in the fat% SNF% and keeping quality (P&lt;0.05)
between some of the milk collecting centers. Bopaththalawa center provided the milk
with the highest quality considering all 3 factors (mean fat%: 4.08, SNF%: 8.51, and
keeping quality: 6 days). Samples produced with the highest initial fat% and lower SMP
had the highest consumer preference. The study results indicated that the consumer
preference for the final product relies on both SMP% and raw milk fat%. Therefore, to
produce a final product with a consistent flavour profile, the manufacturer should
consider using fat-free raw milk and adding cream at the standardization to get the
required fat percentage.

Cookies are baked or cooked snacks or desserts, which are small, flat and sweet in nature.
They can also be bland-flavoured and can be moulded into different shapes. The basic
ingredients used for butter flavoured cookies which are manufactured by the Perera &amp;
Sons Bakers (Pvt) Ltd. are wheat flour, corn starch, sugar, butter, margarine, fresh milk,
salt and leavening agents. The prepared butter flavoured cookies are packed in three
different packaging materials such as metal cans, polypropylene pouch with a tray made
using PVC and paperboard carton with LDPE inner package and a tray made using high
impact polystyrene. The shelf life of butter flavoured cookies packed in all three
packaging materials is four months. This study was conducted to extend the shelf life of
butter flavoured cookies. Two experiments were conducted separately to determine the
most effective concentration of potassium sorbate and to determine the most effective
concentration of ascorbyl palmitate. Potassium sorbate was incorporated into four
different concentrations separately such as 0 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 300
mg/kg and were packed in all packaging materials. Prepared cookies were stored at 45°
C for four weeks and moisture content, hardness, total plate count and yeast and mould
count were determined and sensory evaluations were carried out. Ascorbyl palmitate was
incorporated into four different concentrations such as 0 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg
and 500 mg/kg and were packed in all packaging materials. Prepared cookies were stored
at 45° C for three weeks and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content was measured
and sensory evaluations were carried out. The most effective concentration of potassium
sorbate was 200 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.05) and the most effective concentration of ascorbyl
palmitate was 500 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.05). The most suitable packaging material was the metal
can (P &lt; 0.05).

Coconut haustoria are underutilized, thus their disposal is a challenge faced by coconut
processing industries. As coconut haustorium contains health beneficial compounds, this
study focused on finding out a disinfection treatment for producing minimally processed
and refrigerated (MPR) coconut haustoria. The washed and wiped samples were cut into
wedge-shaped slices (8 mm), and dipped for two min in water as the control (TW) and in
solutions containing 5% H2O2 (HPS), and citric acid (1 g.L-1) and 5% H2O2 (CA&amp;HPS)
as treatments in triplicate. The samples packaged in polypropylene trays and covered with
polyvinylidene chloride films were refrigerated (4 ± 1 oC and 48 ± 17% RH) for two
weeks. Total soluble solids (TSS), pH, and inner and outer firmness values of the control
samples were not significantly different (P>0.05) from the treatments. TPC (total plate
counts) of the control samples was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than that of HPS and
CAS&amp;HPS, resulting in reduction of microbial load by 36%. The slices prepared as
before were dipped for 2 min in a 5% HPS as the control, and for ten min in pre-ozonated
water containing 100 and 200 mg.L-1 of ozone as treatments in triplicate. Afterwards, the
slices stored for two weeks under similar conditions as above. TSS, pH and inner firmness
of the control samples after two weeks in storage were not significantly different (P>0.05)
from the treatments. However, outer firmness of the treatments was significantly higher
(P&lt;0.05) than the control. TPC was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in the control samples
than those treated with water containing 100 and 200 mg.L-1 of ozone, resulting in a
reduction of microbial load by 2 and 14%, respectively. Therefore, treating with pre-
ozonated water containing 200 mg.L-1 of ozone can be recommended as a disinfection
treatment, instead of dipping in H2O2, for producing MPR coconut haustoria.

The application of ultrasound technology in dairy processing is relatively a new field of
study. Ultrasonication alters the properties of milk, allowing for the production of novel-
textured, high-moisture dairy products. This study was conducted to assess the effect of
ultrasonication on lactic acid-induced coagulation of milk from indigenous cattle,
Thamankaduwa White (TW) and exotic cattle, Holstein Friesian (HF). Milk samples
from pure TW and HF were subjected to ultrasonication at 3 different power levels: US
42, US 51, and US 60 with the energy densities 504 JmL-1, 612 JmL-1, and 720 JmL-1,
respectively, for 10 minute duration with temperature control (&lt;40º C). Treated and
untreated milk samples were acidified by adding lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus
thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). Coagulation properties
such as water holding capacity (WHC), syneresis and texture profile analysis (TPA) and
microstructure were determined. Statistical analysis was carried out using a 2-factor
factorial CRD followed by Fisher’s LSD test. The main findings suggest that
ultrasonication increased (p&lt;0.05) the WHC of coagulums from HF milk and decreased
(p&lt;0.05) the WHC of coagulums from TW milk. Ultrasonication increased (p&lt;0.05) the
firmness of coagulums from both TW and HF milk. An interaction effect (p&lt;0.05) of
milk type (breed) and ultrasound energy density on WHC and firmness was observed.
Ultrasonication of raw milk from HF had little effect on the final structure of the
coagulum compared to that of TW. However, at a high level of treatment (i.e., 720 JmL-
1) more porous structures of acid gels from both breeds were observed. Results of the
current study indicate that ultrasound treatment improves the lactic acid coagulation
properties of milk from both breeds. However, the same ultrasound energy density affects
the coagulation properties of milk from both breeds differently.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrasound as pre-treatments on the
physiochemical characteristics of the Seeni and Embul banana varieties in Sri Lanka.
Ultrasound treatment of 25 kHz frequency was applied to physiologically matured,
freshly harvested Seeni and Embul banana fruits for different time periods (0, 10, 20, and
30 min). The ultrasound-treated samples were stored for 4 days at room temperature (28
°C). The changes in firmness (N), °Brix, pH, titratable acidity (TA%), peel color, weight
reduction (%), carbon dioxide (CO2) production rate (ml kg-1 h-1), antioxidant activity
(DPPH radical scavenging activity %) and the light microscopy study of tissue damage
of both banana samples were investigated. The pulp firmness of the banana samples
significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) with the time of ultrasound treatment of both banana
varieties. The CO2 production rate, °Brix, and weight reduction percentage of both
varieties were significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) with the period of ultrasound treatment.
At 30 min of ultrasound treatment time, the antioxidant activity of the Seeni and Embul
bananas increased from 12.05 ± 1.94% to 57.72 ± 3.88%, and 78.52 ± 3.22% to 95.36 ±
0.96% respectively. The peel lightness (L), redness (a), and yellowness (b) values and
the pH reduction of the Embul banana sample did not significantly vary (P>0.05) with
the ultrasound time. However, the “b” value of the Seeni banana samples significantly
increased (P&lt;0.05) with the ultrasound treatments. Microscopic study showed that the
ultrasound treatment time directly affected the microchannel formation and cell damage
of both varieties. Moreover, ultrasound treatment effect on the peel discoloration of the
Embul banana variety was identified as undesirable postharvest quality characteristics.
The results of this study suggested that the ultrasound treatment may provide an
alternative method to enhance the ripening rate and maintain the proper postharvest
quality of and Seeni banana varieties.

Nutritional status is an important indicator for measuring the quality of life of children.
Galkadapthana is a rural agricultural village in the Nuwara Eliya district. Villagers
confront difficulties related to their nutritional status due to low-income levels, education
levels, and infrastructure facilities. This study was undertaken to identify the
relationships between the nutritional status of school children of Galakadapathana
village and their dietary patterns. A community-based cross-sectional study was carried
out using a deductive approach. A total of 85 households with 137 school children in the
age group of 6-18 years were randomly selected. Data was collected using structured
surveys and conducting face-to-face interviews. The nutritional status of children was
assessed through anthropometric measurements. Among 137 school children, there were
71 boys and 66 girls. Stunting was seen in 16.9% of boys and 4.2% were severely stunted
based on height- for- age, according to the WHO standard. Furthermore, 12.1% are
stunted, while 7.6% were severely stunted in girls. Based on the WHO standard for BMI-
for-age, 7.6% of girls and 7.0% of boys were severely underweight. The prevalence of
overweight was 3.6% and obesity was 2.2% of the population. Obesity was
predominantly seen among girls (4.5%), and not observed among boys. The amount of
starchy food intake showed a significant impact on the prevalence of wasting (P&lt;0.05),
but not the dietary diversity.

Tropical homegardens are characterized by a diverse mixture of perennial and annual
plant species arranged in a complex vertical and horizontal structure in which trees play
a dominant role. They have multiple functions, especially in rural areas in Sri Lanka.
Homegarden systems can be considered as one of the best ways to fulfill food and
nutrition requirements of the increasing population. With increasing pressure with land
fragmentation, and food and nutrition requirements of family, it is necessary to identify
potential measures for improvement of home gardens to reach increasing demands. The
objectives of this study were to assess the home garden systems in Akuressa and
Hakmana Divisional Secretariat (DS) of Matara district which belong to wet and
intermediate zones respectively, for their species composition and diversity. For the
study, 60 homegardens were selected randomly as 30 homegardens per each DS division.
Eighty-one different crop species were identified in the homegardens. Tea was the most
dominant crop species found in Akuressa. Coconut, Arecanut, Mango, Jack and Bread
fruit were the other most abundant crop species found in both DS divisions. Higher
number of timber trees was found in Hakmana (13 trees/home garden). Higher number
of fruit trees (20 trees/home garden), export agricultural crops (23 trees/home garden)
and other cash crops were found in Akuressa. Shannon Wiener index was used to
compare the diversity, which showed no differences between Hakmana and Akuressa for
Timber trees (P=0.71), Fruit trees (P=0.65) and Export agricultural crops (P=0.56).
However, it showed a significant difference for other cash crops (P&lt;0.0001). This was
mainly due to the mono crop of tea found abundantly in Akuressa which reduced the
Shannon Wiener index values.

Feed cost occupies around 70% of the cost of production in poultry operations and
justifies efficient feed utilization. The potential for developing a digital application to
support record-keeping and efficient feed utilization was evaluated by assessing farmers’
needs as the initial step. This study investigated the responses of poultry farmers to a
structured questionnaire based on their awareness of feed efficiency, current record-
keeping practices, and digital literacy. Data were collected from 72 poultry farmers in
Dummalasuriya veterinary region through a primary survey. Data were analysed using
descriptive analytics and the Chi-square test by SPSS version 22 software. The sample
comprised mainly layer (80.5%) and broiler (19.5%) farmers. Most farmers (72%) have
multiple batch systems of rearing birds that generate more data to be recorded, justifying
the need for a proper record-keeping system. Most farmers (97%) were aware that the
feed cost is the highest contribution to the total cost of production. Farmers’ awareness
of feed efficiency was associated (P&lt;0.05) with their education level. Despite the higher
awareness of feed conversion ratio (FCR) in more educated farmers, the practice of
calculating FCR was influenced by the type of bird (P&lt;0.05), showing their perspective
that FCR is only for broiler chicken. Irrespective of the scale of operation and level of
commitment, around 80% of farmers kept records. Only one farmer uses an app currently.
Nevertheless, most farmers were willing to use an app (65%), with 94% preference for
using it on a mobile device. Around 83% of the farmers who were willing to use an app
had no access to a desktop computer. These findings justify and facilitate the
development of a mobile application for improving feed efficiency, and recommend
providing skills, literacy and logistics for digital involvement in poultry operations for an
efficient use of valuable feed resources.

A Review of Fundamentals and Applications Involved in Stereotypic
Behaviors in Zoo Animals

Department of Animal Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Animal and human activities that are repetitive, unvarying and purposeless are described
as stereotypic behaviours. Frustration to perform normal behavioural patterns, brain
malfunction or repeated attempts to fix some problems are identified among many causes
of these behaviours. Stereotypic behaviours are observed in many categories of animals
including farm and pet animals. However, in wild animals, especially mammals in
captivity frequently perform stereotypic behaviours that indicates stress from inadequate
adaptation to captivity which is a serious welfare concern. Some common forms of
stereotypies observed in captive conditions include repeated swaying of the whole body
from one side to the other, weaving with the head, swinging the trunk, lifting the feet and
bobbing up and down with the head in captive elephants. Pacing, head-bobbing, rocking,
walking in circles, compulsive licking, bar biting, and self-mutilation are commonly
observed stereotypies in carnivores such as captive tigers, leopards and lions. In non-
human primates, self-clasping, rocking, eye poking, pacing, coprophagy, head shake and
hair picking have been commonly observed. In this review, fundamental causes of
stereotypic behaviours, welfare implications and some strategies that have been adopted
to mitigate stereotypic behaviours (i.e., social, feeding and environmental enrichments)
are discussed mainly focusing captive elephants, carnivores and non-human primates.

Wild animal damage is a big challenge for the cultivation and management of home
garden crops across the country making significant yield losses, physical damages, and
provoking financial losses. The Kandyan home garden system (KHGS) is considered one
of the most sustainable agricultural ecosystems and wild animal attack in the KHGS has
increased at an alarming rate over the last two decades. The present study aimed to
understand and analyze the current situation of crop damage by wild animals within the
KHGS. A questionnaire survey was conducted in 60 home gardens in the Kandy district.
The quadrat method was used to assess the crop damage of the wild animal attack in six
selected home gardens over two months. The risk index and severity index were
calculated to access the risk and the severity of the wild animal damage. Currently
practiced control methods were also assessed for their effectiveness and the
ethnobiological knowledge related to wild animal damage was also extracted. Data were
analyzed using the chi-square test and descriptive statistics methods. This study
confirmed that wild animal attack is a main problem in the KHGS which requires
immediate attention. Monkey is the most distractive and severe animal, and they have
adapted to most of the widely practiced control measures. The highest risk index was
observed for wild boars (0.870), followed by monkeys (0.833), porcupines (0.790), and
giant squirrels (0.550). The peacock attack is not significant in KHGS yet. Annona,
avocado, rambutan, guava, and durian was found to have more than 70% of yield losses
due to wild animal damage. The currently practiced methods would not be effective to
control wild animal attacks in KHGS. It implies that a well-focused strategic plan is
required to handle this issue without further delay.

Department of Crop Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Gliricidia sepium is the most widely known cultivated species which belongs to genus
Gliricidia is a tree species with several remarkable attributes. As a result it is popular
among the farming communities of the Asian and Pacific region. Even though, weighing
of the actual tree biomass in the field is the most accurate method to determine tree
biomass, it is an extremely time consuming and destructive method. Use of allometric
relationships yields a non-destructives and indirect measurement of biomass components
and is often the preferred approach since it is less time consuming and less expensive
than direct measurements. Development of relationship between biomass and diameter
is very useful for the timber merchants and to the officers who are involved in the legal
procedures of felling. This study was carried out to identify the relationship among tree
biomass and diameter at the breast height, basal diameters and tree height. For this
purpose different fitted models were tested to select a most appropriate model. To
develop the relationship between biomass/carbon stock and the tree parameters (Tree
height, Diameter, Weight) 22 trees were felled and measured. Standing trees 732, were
measured for their diameter and height and predicted the weight and carbon stock based
on felled trees. A number of non-linear models were used to identify the best fitted model
for biomass estimation using SPSS software. Coefficient of determination (R²) and RMSE
was used to identify the appropriate model. Polynomial quadratic model was found as the
best model for estimating the above ground fresh biomass and carbon stock of Gliricidia
sepium. No relationship between biomass with tree height was observed due to maturity
of the trees. Most appropriate fitted model for total biomass was: Total weight :w = -
5.949 *D20+1.142* D202. Most appropriate fitted model for total carbon stock was ,Total
carbon stock :C=- 2.974 *D20 + 0.571 * D202 (D20;Diameter at the 20cm above root

Information about the nature of transactions by economic agents and the importance of
such in the income distribution within economies provide designing social safety nets.
However, this information is rarely available for rural communities. This research aimed
to identify economic transactions that are taking place within rural households in a
selected rural community, quantify the values of transactions, identify the shares of
different parties involved in the transactions, and identify the shares of households within
and outside of the area. Ellis's (2000) "Sustainable Livelihoods Framework Model" is
used as the theoretical framework. Data were collected from 100 randomly selected 100
households from Diddenipotha village in the Matara district of Sri Lanka. A structured
survey schedule was used. Economic transactions that are currently taking place within
households were identified and listed. Binary logistic regression was used to model the
relationship between the current employment status and current financial status. Whitney
U test was used to check the difference between the quantity of labor within the village
and outside of the village. Findings show that there is a significant difference between
the quantity of labour used within the village and outside of the village Sixty-five percent
of households engage in farming and the sale of farm produce. Thirty-one percent of
household heads are tea estate labourers. Some households can be included in neither as
labor-hiring nor labor-supplying since they are engaging in self-employment or using
family members to work in their fields.

This study was conducted to design, develop and evaluate a podcast series to assess the
potential of the podcast for agricultural information dissemination to coconut
smallholders in the Kurunegala district. The study was mainly focused on the Wallawa
Coconut Development Officer’s area in the Kurunegala Coconut Cultivation Board
region. ADDIE (Analysis, Designing, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation)
instructional design model was followed for the production process. Study community
characteristics and coconut cultivation-related information gaps were identified using a
baseline survey (n=40), key informant interviews, and focus group discussion. Content
for the podcasts was developed, organized, and recorded with the collaboration of the
Technology Transfer Division, Coconut Research Institute. Podcasts were presented to
the subject expert panel for content validation and to get expert suggestions to improve
the podcast. Feedback from the experts was obtained through an online survey and
telephone interviews. 35 coconut smallholders in the Wallawa area were recruited and a
WhatsApp group was created for the implementation of the finalized Podcast. A short-
term WhatsApp Extension campaign was launched to implement the podcast series. The
effectiveness of the podcast series was evaluated through an online survey (n=35) and
telephone interviews (n=11). According to the finding’s majority of the listeners,
perceived information disseminated in the programs was very useful (60%), it is easier
to get agricultural information through podcasts (96%) and the use of podcasts to
disseminate agricultural information is successful (64%). The study concludes that
podcasts can be used to disseminate agricultural information related to coconut
cultivation in the selected community and communities with similar conditions. The
developed podcast series can be integrated into the digital information communication
platforms of the Coconut Cultivation Board and Coconut Research Institutes.

The economic crisis in Sri Lanka creates severe impacts on estate sector food security.
This study attempts to estimate the food consumption changes, identify the determinants
of food insecurity dimensions, especially the shock factors related to consumption and
status of the household food security. The study was carried out with 100 households,
selected using stratified random sampling, at the Kataboola estate in Nawalapitya. Data
collection involved interviews using a structured questionnaire. According to the results,
households reduced the quantity of wheat (58.7 percent), chicken (70.8 percent), egg
(54.8 percent), fish (57.9 percent) and milk powder (73.3 percent) during the crisis
episode. Further analysis by multiple linear regression identified the relationship between
food insecurity dimensions with the socio- economic factors and shock factors. Food
unavailability was negatively impacted by total household income and protein
availability shock. Lack of access was also associated with income negatively but
positively related with number of household members, number of Samurdhi beneficiaries
and transport expenditure. Food underutilization was positively impacted by medical
expenditure but negatively related to total household income and the number of sick
members. The food instability is positively impacted by total number of members and
negatively impacted by total household income. The results also displayed that about 56
percent of the households are at the moderate food secure level and 42 percent of the
households are in an ‘urgent-action-required’ situation. Households increased their food
expenditure, but this was not sufficient to compensate for the effects of price inflation.
This study provides insights which will have important policy implications on the
development interventions in the estate sector.

Pseudomonas spp. are Gram-negative bacteria widespread in aquatic environments. They
are well-known pathogens of fish, terrestrial animals and humans. The objectives of this
study were to characterize Pseudomonas spp. from freshwater ornamental fish and their
farming environment and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility and presence of
integrons. Ten freshwater ornamental fish farms located in the Kurunegala and Puttalam
districts (5 each) were visited during the period of August-September 2022. Samples
were collected from the skin mucus of apparently-healthy ornamental fish and their
farming environment (i.e. tank water, tank sediment and biofilms) and cultured on
trypticase soy agar and glutamate starch phenol red agar. Pseudomonas spp. were
identified using morphological characteristics and conventional biochemical tests.
Genetic confirmation at the genus level was done by PCR using Pseudomonas genus-
specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Susceptibility against 5 antimicrobials was
determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The presence of integrons, their
class and resistant gene cassettes was determined by PCR. A total of 41 Pseudomonas
spp. were isolated and characterized. The antimicrobial resistance frequencies of the
isolated Pseudomonas spp. were; erythromycin (82.93%), amoxicillin (78%),
chloramphenicol (56.10%), enrofloxacin (14.63%) and tetracycline (9.76%). Among
them, 53.66% isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 73.17% had multiple
antibiotic resistance (MAR) indices of > 0.2, suggesting they originate from high-risk
sources of contamination where antibiotics are used frequently. However, only 2 isolates
(4.87%) carried integrons of class 1 and one of them had a class 1 gene cassette. Our
findings revealed that freshwater aquarium fish and their farming environment act as
reservoirs of MDR Pseudomonas spp. They may disseminate directly or indirectly via
ornamental fish and cause difficult-to-treat infections in humans. Our findings highlight
the importance of the judicious use of antimicrobials in aquaculture and responsible fish
ownership.

Tropical fruits have a higher demand from international market and many countries in
the tropics can capitalize on this opportunity to earn foreign exchange. Accessing the
international fresh fruit market is constrained by the non-tariff measures (NTMs). Better
understanding of the nature of NTMs and their effects is a pre-requirement to enter the
international fresh fruit market. This study focuses on mango exports from Sri Lanka,
NTM related rejections, main NTMs facing mango exports from Sri Lanka, and analyses
the effects of NTMs on mango exports. To extract the mango internal and external
rejections National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS) database were used. To identify and
classify the main NTMs affecting mangos, the frequency and coverage ratios were
calculated using the UNCTAD TRAINS database. To determine the effect of NTMs on
mango exports from Sri Lanka, two gravity models were estimated using a panel data set.
Bilateral exports of mango at HS 6-digit level were regressed against NTMs for 16
countries for the period 2000 to 2021. The total number of NTMs and specific NTMs
related to Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) conditions (A8) were included in the models.
The results shows main reasons for internal and external rejections were the presence of
pests namely seed weevil and fruit fly and absence of phyto-certification. The incidences
of NTM revealed that mango exports in Sri Lanka are critically regulated by SPS,
Technical barriers to Trade (TBT), and pre shipment inspection formalities (PSI). The
results of the gravity model indicate that TBT, and PSI have positive effects, and total
NTMs, SPS, and conformity assessment of SPS have negative effects on mango exports.
The results imply NTM and NTM related measures have a considerable impact on mango
exports in Sri Lanka illustrating the need to keep higher attention on NTMs to enhance
fresh fruits exports.

Plastic grocery bags can cause a variety of environmental problems. Even though a ban
on using polythene with a thickness below 20 microns was imposed in 2017, the intended
outcome could not be achieved due to the ignorance of consumer preferences of the
authorities and the unavailability of suitable alternatives at a reasonable price. In this
context this study was carried out to evaluate how people value environmentally friendly
approaches against polythene grocery bags, to estimate the different trade-offs among the
consumer preferences on packaging material, and to evaluate the relative importance of
each attributes of packaging materials. Research design is developed based on random
utility models as a discrete choice experiment. Four attributes, namely reusability,
environmental friendliness, convenience &amp; availability and price per unit use with three
levels each generated 81 treatment combinations and this was reduced to 9 choice sets
using Fractional factorial design. The study population was supermarket consumers in
Kurunegala district. The study generated 440 observations which were analyzed through
a conditional logistic regression model in STATA 14.0. Part-Worth Utilities were
calculated according to coefficients of variables. Consumers are willing to pay an
additional amount of money over current price for attributes and their levels of shopping
bags. Consumers’ Marginal willingness to pay is highest, when shopping bags are more
times reusability. Consumers’ Marginal willingness to pay is lowest, when shopping bags
have moderate biodegradability. Consumers are willing to pay iaround Rs.9.13 for one-
time use with desirable environmental characteristics including reusability, bio-
degradability, and convenience. Due to consumers’ Marginal willingness to pay is
highest, when polythene bags are more times reusability, reusable bags can be promoted
and improved by banning single-use polythene bags, using technology, promoting the use
of polyester reusable bags, increasing the availability and affordability of reusable bags,
promoting the use of polyester reusable bag.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Badagamuwa conservation forest is a semi natural forest located on the wayside of
Kurunegala-Dambulla road (A6 road). The forest is resulted from forest regeneration
followed by the abandonment of the plantation for several decades. The forest has been
subjected to some studies especially identifications of species. However, interpretation
of data is mainly limited to a list of species found in the forest. Quantification and
calculation of indices of flora have been not developed in the past. As the forest cover
has led to destruction by economic activities and development projects in the area, it is
important to assess the biodiversity in the forest for the implementation of appropriate
conservation management practices. Accordingly the objective of this study was to assess
the floristic diversity and species composition of Badagamuwa conservation forest. The
experiment was carried out in the forest by randomly allocated 20 sample plots of 20 m
× 20 m. The number of seedlings, saplings and trees were identified and recorded to
species level. Diameter at breast height of all plant species above 10 cm and height of all
plant species above 1.3 m were measured along with their numbers. Shannon - Weiner
index, Simpson diversity index and Important Value Index were calculated. The study
plots were documented with 75 species belonging to 28 families. The most dominant tree
species identified were Swietenia macrophylla (introduced), Artocarpus hirsutus
(introduced), Artocarpus heterophyllus and Tectona grandis (introduced). According to
the relative abundance, the most abundant plants species detected were Polyalthia korinti
(12.1%), Stachytarpheta urticifolia (12.0%) and Glycosmis angustifolia (10.5 %) which
all were native shrub layer species. Introduced species such as Swietenia macrophylla,
Tectona grandis, Artocarpus hirsutus and Berrya cordifolia were dominant in saplings
and trees compared to native/endemic species. Shannon-Weiner index and Simpson
diversity index were 2.6±0.22 and 0.875±0.08 respectively.

Food safety plays a significant role in reducing the occurrences of food borne illnesses.
When considering seafood safety, the fish retailers knowledge, attitudes and practices
(KAP) play a vital role. This survey aimed to assess the KAP of the onsite fish retailers
of the Western Province in Sri Lanka. Further the study aimed to find out the association
between KAP and socio demographic variables of respondents. A pre tested
questionnaire consisted of four main sections; socio demographic variables, knowledge,
attitude and practices was used for the survey. Randomly selected 150 fish retailers were
chosen to evaluate the KAP. Direct observation and in-depth interviews were conducted
to collect the qualitative data. The data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package
for the Social Science) version 26. Kruskal Wallis H test was (P&lt;0.1) used to examine
the socio demographic variables with KAP. Pearsons’ correlation analysis was (P&lt;0.05)
conducted to measure the relationship between KAP. Linear regression model was used
to assess the strength of the correlation (P&lt;0.05) between knowledge and attitudes.
Eighty-eight percentage of the participants were males and the highest number of
responses were from the age group of 40 to 60 years. The overall score of the knowledge,
attitudes and practices of the fish retailers were 38% (good), 95.33% (positive) and 0.6%
(poor), respectively. There were significant relationships between practices with gender,
knowledge with age and the attitudes with monthly income. The findings revealed a weak
but positive correlation (rs= 0.178) between knowledge and attitude towards the food
safety. There was a significant correlation between knowledge and attitude of fish
retailers while food safety practices were independent. The knowledge and attitudes of
fish retailers on seafood safety are good and positive respectively while their food safety
practices on seafood safety is poor.

The dietary patterns and nutritional status of young adults are important determinants of
their health and performance. Therefore, the cross-sectional case study was conducted to
explore the dietary practices and nutritional status of undergraduate students of the
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya. Further, the study aimed to determine
the factors associated with fruit and vegetable intake and anthropometric indices of
nutritional status. The study sample consisted of 186 students representing all academic
years of the Faculty. The weight (kg), height (m), waist circumference (WC) and hip
circumference (HC) were measured to calulate the Body Mass Index (BMI), and the
Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR). The socio-demographic, lifestyle and dietary data were
collected using an online survey. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 26.0). The
majority of the sample was Sinhala (96.7%), female (73.7%) students residing in the
university hostels (65.6%). The mean age of the sample was 24.5 years. The commonly
consumed fruits among the students were banana, avocado, wood apple, and papaya and
the vegetables were carrot, beans, pumpkin, and beetroot. The mean fruit and vegetable
intake of students per day was 1.37 (±1.34) and 2.42 (±1.66), respectively. Only 21.5%
of the students achieved the recommended fruit intake, while 25.8% achieved the
recommended vegetable intake. Based on the Asia-Pasific classification, 47.9% of
students were normal weight while 23.1% were underweight, 19.4% were overweight
and 9.7% were obese. The place of residence, province, age category and family income
were significantly related to the fruit and vegetable intake (P&lt;0.05). There was no
significant difference (P>0.05) in the fruit and vegetable intake by the BMI categories.
The factors associated with the BMI and WC were gender, time of stop eating food and
water intake. Only gender and age categories were significantly related to the WHR
(P&lt;0.05).

In this study, assessment of the existing level of food security, biodiversity, and ecosystem
services was done using 20 Kandyan homegardens located in Peradeniya, Pilimathalawa,
and Doluwa areas in the Kandy district. All homegardens were grouped into 3 as small
(&lt;0.04 ha), medium (0.04-0.09 ha), and large (>0.09 ha) considering the size of the
homegarden. The biodiversity of homegardens was quantified using Shannon Wiener
index, and it ranged between 2.02 and 2.74. Species richness was 52 species and ranged
from 8 to 21 species among homegardens. There was no significant difference in species
richness with the size of the homegarden (P>0.05). The abundance of the homegardens
was significantly high (P&lt;0.05) in medium and large homegardens compared to small
homegardens. The evenness ranged between 0.76 and 0.97 irrespective of the size of the
homegarden (P>0.05). The species density per hectare (range 24 - 813), and tree density
per hectare (range 61 - 1500) were found to be significantly different with respect to the
size of the homegarden (P&lt;0.0001). There were 23 vegetables, 14 leafy vegetables, 25
fruits, 7 spices, and 13 herb species identified within the sampled homegardens. Some
homegardens are rearing poultry and livestock. The above-ground (AGB) carbon stocks
in sampled homegardens ranged from 4.4 to 100.7 Mg C ha-1 with a mean value of 36.5
Mg C ha-1. The proportion of AGB carbon stocks compared to the total carbon stock was
high in Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus). Different ecosystem services were also
identified. Well-managed Kandyan homegardens ensure food security and ecosystem
services, which can be adapted by poorly managed categories with identified species to
achieve food security through an increasing number of species, introduction, and
management of tree species.

Microplastics are an emerging contaminant in the environment as it threatens the living
creatures in aquatic as well as terrestrial environments. There are increasing number of
evidence of accumulating microplastic contaminants in the world, especially in
agricultural lands. However, evidence of microplastic pollution in agricultural soils of Sri
Lanka are rare; therefore, this study was conducted to assess the microplastic
contamination in five fields of upland vegetable cultivation systems of Sri Lanka. Soil
samples were collected from five fields; two locations at Meewatura Experimental
Station of University of Peradeniya, Gannoruwa Field Experimental Station, a farmland
in Doragala, and a farmland in Nuwara Eliya, where there is a history of plastic mulch
usage. The soil samples were taken from 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depth layers and all general
chemical and physical parameters were tested. Microplastic analysis was done by
digesting the soil using H2O2 solution, and density separation with NaCl solution. The
extracted microplastics were counted under a light microscope, pictures were taken to
record shape factors, and weighted using analytical balance. The results revealed that the
number of microplastic particles in fields were ranging from 2,550±70.8 to 5,800±424
particles kg-1 of soil and Nuwara Eliya strawberry cultivation field had significantly
higher number though there was no significant difference between depth layers. The
microscopic analysis showed that fragment particles were dominant in Meewatura field
(50-70%) while filament particles were greater in other fields. Black, transparent and blue
color microplastics were dominant over other colors such as red, yellow, purple, and
white. The estimated plastic contamination levels were comparable to reported values in
agricultural fields of other countries. In conclusion, the preliminary research revealed that
the assessed fields of upland agricultural cultivation system of Sri Lanka are
contaminated by microplastics that could have been originated from plastics utilities,
agro-inputs and runoff flow into agricultural fields.

Riparian ecosystems which are lying on the riverbanks are highly diverse in nature and
also referred eco-tones since they are located in between terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems. Sri Lanka, an island of Indian Ocean comprises 103 natural rivers; therefore
studying about riparian ecosystems of the country is significant in ecological purposes.
This study was conducted to assess the riparian vegetation of the Weoya, a left bank
tributary of Kelani River, Sri Lanka, under four land use categories, namely Rubber
Buffer Zone (RBZ), Encroached Riverbank Reservation (ERR), Homegarden based
Riparian (HGR) and Natural Riparian (NRF). Plots of 5 m ×20 m established
perpendicular to the riverbanks from shallow water depth were again divided into two-
transverse adjoined plots. Vegetation diversity of each land use was calculated for three
strata; canopy, understory and ground cover, using Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index
(SWI). From experimental plots, 182 floral species were recorded and categorized under
trees, vines, shrubs, herbs, grasses and ferns. Nested factor factorial model and ANOVA
procedure were used to analyze data at P&lt;0.05 significance. Results show that canopy
SWI is significantly higher in RBZ and NRF than ERR and HGR showing human
influences to reduce tree diversity. Understory SWI is significantly low in upper plots
than lower plots while ground cover shows no significant difference in SWI. Due to
presence in all land use categories and also due to the suitability, Areca catechu, Caryota
urens, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Madhuca neriifolia, Hydnocarpus venenatus,
Horsfieldia iryaghedhi, Bambusa vulgaris and Barringtonia racemosa were identified as
suitable tree species to plant on the riverbanks of Weoya catchment.

Global agriculture is now facing challenges, and important challenges for agriculture at
the global level may be identified. Climate change, limited arable land area, and limited
agricultural inputs are all common among the primary challenges stated, and they all
require common solutions. Experts recommend going with green agriculture as a
solution, as well as developing and testing ways to restore damaged areas to arable status.
The purpose of this study is to assess the appropriateness of a naturally generated tea-
coffee agroforestry integrated ecosystem model for restoring degraded lands to arable
status. In the study, the tea-coffee agroforestry model was compared to the natural forest
ecosystem and tea cultivated land. As major sections of study, the aboveground biomass,
soil health, bio diversity, and economic production were all tested in three ecosystems.
For that, each ecosystem was examined for, soil parameters (total nitrogen, available
potassium, available phosphorus, pH, EC, OM%, OC%, soil macro faunal density,
physical parameters: sand%, silt%, clay%, bulk density), Biological parameters (floral
variety, floral density, soil surface insect density, aboveground biomass), and economic
outcome from each ecosystem. The one factor factorial experimental method was used
to analyze data, and mean comparisons revealed that soil organic matter%, soil organic
carbon%, soil EC, average Shannon Weiner index, average floral species evenness,
average floral density (&lt;5cm diameter), average floral diversity (&lt;5cm diameter), and
total average ground insect count had comparatively higher and significant different
values. Different levels of soil total nitrogen, available potassium, soil average pH, and
floral species density were shown to be comparably lower and significant in the findings
(all plant species from ground cover). As a consequence of the findings, the tea-coffee
agroforestry model is in the midst of the secondary successional phase and may be
successfully applied to create arable land from degraded land.

Cognitive Factors Affecting Soil Conservation Efforts of Farmers in the
Hill Country of Sri Lanka: An Insight from Galkadapathana Village in the
Walapane Divisional Secretariat

Department of Agricultural Extension,

Soil erosion and loss of soil fertility are burgeoning environmental issues with adverse
repercussions on farm livelihoods in the Hill Country of Sri Lanka. Expansion and
intensification of commercial vegetable farming, in the absence of adequate efforts to
curb soil erosion and nutrient loss at the farm level, have led to soil degradation at an
alarming rate in the Central Hills. Although farmers have been constantly made aware of
the risks of soil degradation on their livelihoods by the extension and other state agencies,
adoption of soil conservation measures in the Hill region still remains at an unsatisfactory
level. Soil conservation, in an agrarian context, is the sustainable utilization of available
land resources, application of erosion control measures, and adoption of suitable cropping
patterns with the goal of maintaining soil productivity and soil health. This study, with
reference to a sample of farmers (n = 60) drawn from the Galkadapathana GN division
of the Walapane Divisional Secretariat, was conducted to reveal the cognitive factors
(i.e., values, perceived risk, perceived behavioural control and perceived benefits of soil
conservation) that would predict the adoption of soil conservation practices by the Hill
farmers. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed
to validate the measurement model and to test the hypotheses. The SmartPLS-4 was used
to assess both the measurement model and the structural model. The results confirmed
the validity of the model. The findings of the research depicted the pervasive role of
farmers’ perceived behavioural control in predicting their tendency to adopt soil
conservation measures. The finding of this study can contribute to develop programs to
motivate farmers to adopt soil conservation practices.

This study aimed to evaluate the consumer awarene ss and acceptance of insect-based
food and feed in Sri Lanka, and to determine whether the acceptance can be increased by
provision of information. A web-based survey was conducted with 1059 participants to
determine consumer awareness and acceptance. Among the participants, 93%, 43% and
33% were aware of insect-based food, feed and pet food, respectively. The probability of
being aware of insect-based food was significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower among males than
among females. The probability of being insects aware of insect-based feed was
significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher among people aged 18-30 years than among people aged
below 18 years. A majority (75%) of participants in the survey were willing to eat insect-
based food or food produced from animals fed with, where a majority of them was
willing to eat insects-fed chicken eggs. Acceptance of insect-based food and feed among
males was significantly (P&lt;0.05) high compared to that among females, and low among
Hindus compared to Buddhists. A paper-based survey was conducted (using 210 third-
year undergraduate students) to evaluate whether the provision of information could
change the level of acceptance. The participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups
(n=70): the control group (no information), group provided with information via a leaflet,
and group provided with information via a video. The acceptance of insects-based food
was significantly (P&lt;0.1) high in the video group compared to the control group, whereas
there was no difference between leaflet and control groups. The acceptance of insects-
based feed and pet food was not affected by the information provided. In conclusion,
there is a potential to use insects as a food and feed source in Sri Lanka, and consumer
acceptance of insect-based food can be increased by provision of information via video.

Local tea consumption in Sri Lanka is at a lower level. In addition, the threat of Sri Lanka
losing its comparative advantage in the global tea market is ever looming. A dearth of
literature provides evidence of the health benefits of black tea in a Sri Lankan context.
Within this milieu, this study aims to assess the impact of socio-demographic factors on
the awareness of the health benefits, and differences in perceptions among different
consumer segments towards black tea consumption and to investigate the possibility of
health-related marketing in black tea. A case study was carried out using a cross-sectional
questionnaire by recruiting 150 local and foreign individuals over 18 years old, in the
Nuwara-Eliya DS division by adopting cluster and convenient sampling respectively. The
questionnaire focused on socio-demographic and awareness-related information,
consumer perceptions based on the health belief model, and health-related marketing
aspects based on a discrete choice model. Awareness of cardiovascular disease
prevention got the highest mean score whereas bone health got the lowest. Education
level and marital status positively, and age negatively affected the level of awareness
(p&lt;0.05). MANOVA results depict there are significant differences in consumer
perceptions among immigration statuses, education and awareness levels (p&lt;0.05).
Multinomial logit regression results depict the probabilities of secondary and tertiary
educated respondents choosing choices 4 (light color, sweet taste, high price with health
benefits) and 2 (dark color, bitter taste, low price without health benefits) got positive
and negative coefficients respectively. Choice 3 (dark color, bitter taste, low price with
health benefits) was the base outcome. It could be concluded, (1) Consumer awareness
is at a medium level (2) Age, education level, and marital status affect the level of
awareness (3) Differences in perceptions among immigration statuses, education, and
awareness levels (4) A possibility of health-related marketing in black tea.

Even the most optimistic forecasts do not guarantee that the animal feed industry can
meet the future global requirements for traditional feed ingredients. Therefore, an
increasing interest in locally available, low-cost alternative feed ingredients (AFI) is
evident. The primary aim of this study was to identify the current practices and future
potentials of using AFI in self-mixed feed production based on self-mixers' experiences,
production scale, and education level. A pre-tested questionnaire was used in face-to-face
interviews with poultry feed self-mixers in Dummalasuriya veterinary region, North-
Western Province, Sri Lanka. The responses collected from 61 self-mixers were
statistically analyzed using the Chi-square and Ordinal Logistic Regression tests in SPSS
version 22.0. According to results, around 84% of poultry feed self-mixers were
commercial layer farmers. Only 13% of self-mixers were using AFI in their self-mixed
feed production. Self-mixers' willingness to use AFI was impacted by the production
scale (P&lt;0.05), as the willingness to use AFI was lowered with higher production scales.
Constraints for adaptation to AFI were associated with the production scale and education
level of the self-mixers (P&lt;0.05). The impact of lack of awareness on AFI was higher for
small- and medium-scale self-mixers than for large-scale self-mixers (OR>1). The self-
mixers who had higher education beyond secondary education were more aware of AFI
(OR>1). The impact of insufficient supply of AFI was more detrimental for large-scale
self-mixers compared to small- and medium-scale self-mixers (OR&lt;1). Educating the
self-mixers about the available AFI and its technical applications would improve the use
of AFI by small-and medium-scale self-mixers. On the other hand, encouraging
investments in large-scale AFI production to ensure a continuous supply is recommended
to popularize AFI usage by large-scale self-mixers.

The food inflation in Sri Lanka is rising starting from November 2021, at one of the
fastest rates and has reached a peak of 94.9% (Y-o-Y) in September 2022, threatening
the food and nutrition security of the population. This study attempts to identify the
drivers of food inflation in Sri Lanka during the period 2016 to 2022 using Cointegration
and Error-correction models to analyze monthly data. Our findings suggest that the recent
price surge is a result of changes in the exchange rate, crude oil, and agricultural wages.
The Impulse Response Function revealed that food inflation responds positively to the
shocks in world food prices, crude oil prices agricultural wages and exchange rate. The
response to exchange rate shocks was immediate. The variance decomposition analysis
further revealed that food price inflation accounts for a significant portion of volatility on
its own shocks. Exchange rate was found to be a major driver of food inflation in the
short run, however, the effect of exchange rate diminishes with the time. Contradicting
to this, the effect of changes in agriculture wages, oil prices and global food prices is
higher in the long-run than in the short-run. The findings stress the importance of having
appropriate policies to stabilize the exchange rate and input prices to avoid excessive
food inflation in the country.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Household food waste is driven by consumer habits and behavior. It differs with various
demographic, social, and economic factors. This study aims to determine whether
household food waste is a luxury good or not and identify how demographic and
socioeconomic factors affect household food waste. For this, a Quadratic Almost,Ideal
Demand System (QUAIDS) model was used, which is augmented with demographic,
socio-economical, and expenditure controls. From 195 respondents, using an online
survey, we obtained data on food habits and food waste in the Kurunegala district for
October 2022. In this case, food categories were selected basedon the consumption of
most households in Sri Lanka, namely, rice, other kinds of cereals, pulses, fruits,
vegetables, meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, and miscellaneous foods. Expenditure on the
waste of each food category was calculated by multiplying expenditure on each food
category with the percentage of waste, and then expenditureshare on each household food
waste was obtained. The demand system estimation showed that all food waste categories
are normal goods i.e., expenditure elasticities were all positive. Based on the expenditure
elasticities, food waste categories were demarcated as luxury goods or necessity goods.
Waste of rice, other cereals, pulses, fruits, vegetables, and miscellaneous food at the
household level were necessity goods, while the waste of meat products, fish, dairy
products, and eggs food categories were luxury goods. Expenditure share on household
food waste differs with residence area.High-income group of households shows higher
expenditure shares on food waste, lowest in the low-income group, and in between among
middle-income households. Expenditure shares and expenditure elasticities vary with
demographic, social, and economic factors. According to the study, most households
practiced different management practices and they had positive attitudes toward
minimizing household food waste.

Home gardening is considered as a key strategy when it comes to ensure the food security
in a given community. Urban communities are vulnerable for food insecurity. Television
programs are preferred by urban communities to receive information. This study was
conducted to the design and develop a video program to motivate urban dwellers to
practice home gardening. A preliminary need identification was conducted with 20 urban
home gardeners, in Kandy district. Majority (90%) of them watched television and
preferred short duration video clips (73%). Thus a video program structure having three
independent segments namely i) entrepreneurship ideas for home gardens, ii) success
story and iii) do it yourself task were produced. Locations for video recordings were
selected based on key informant discussions. The video contents were evaluated using a
questionnaire, with 25 urban dwellers, selected conveniently. The respondents reaction
was positive that many of them stated the content is attractive (83.3%), motivating
(69.6%), and of suitable duration (40.9%). Study concludes that the educational video
contents have the potential to motivate agricultural communities for home gardening.
Further research is required to test the knowledge obtained and any behavioral change of
participants.

Constructed floating treatment wetlands (CFTW) are a new intervention to purify urban
lakes that are polluted. The selection of appropriate plants for the CFTW is crucial and
requires scientific methodology. The objective of this study was to develop an
appropriate methodology for plant selection for FTWs for wastewater treatment. The
study consisted of three phases: Criteria selection, screening system, and field study for
verification. A literature review followed by preliminary screening using 5 criteria: plants
available or not available in Sri Lanka, invasive/non-invasive, aquatic/terrestrial,
perennial/annual, and adapted/not adapted to submerged conditions. Weighted scoring
was adopted to select 3 plant types i.e., most, moderately, and least suitable for the field
implementation. The selected 3 types of plants were used to establish the CFTW in Kandy
Lake, Kandy. The plants were harvested after 40 days of planting for the assessment of
total nitrogen (N), total available Phosphorous (P), and biomass. The data obtained were
statistically analyzed using the pooled t-test in SAS software. Finally, the validation of
the developed methodology was carried out. The literature review identified 50 plants
used for the CFTW and 9 plants were screened which are suitable for Sri Lankan
conditions. Canna indica, Dracaena sanderiana, and Vetiveria zizanioides (L.) were
identified after weighted scoring as the most, moderately, and least suitable plants.,
respectively. The average biomass increases of Canna indica, Dracaena sanderiana,
and Vetiveria zizanioides (L.) were 57.50%, 8.18%, and 30.18%, respectively, and their
average nutrient removal rates were 88.82%, 2.89%, and 24.98% for N and 66.80%, -
39.36%, and -50.20% for P, respectively. It is concluded that Canna indica is the best
plant for FTWs under Sri Lankan conditions. Since this study considered nutrient
removal efficiency as a parameter for the methodology, further studies are suggested on
assessing the other relevant parameters for selecting plants for CFTW.

A healthy diet plays an important role in the maintenance of a healthy human body. Daily
food consumption is influenced by food choices. Therefore, awareness about healthy and
nutritious food consumption is important to improve the health status of a population.
Food retail environments are settings that make food available and accessible to
consumers. Modern food retail environments such as supermarkets have been identified
as major contributors to consumers’ choice of unhealthy foods in Sri Lanka leading to an
alarming increase in non-communicable diseases. The foods available in the
supermarkets may be classified as healthy to moderately healthy and unhealthy
depending on the composition of the food and the health status of consumers. Therefore,
consumers need more awareness to make healthy food choices. Healthy supermarket
interventions are designed as a public health approach to promote and encourage healthy
food purchasing. This research aimed to develop healthy supermarket initiatives for a
supermarket chain in Sri Lanka by compiling a guidebook that includes retail foods
identified as “healthy” and “unhealthy” food choices based on food composition and the
health status of the Sri Lankan population. The research resulted in a guidebook (ISBN
978-624-97482-1-7) which comprises healthy food choices concerning specific health
conditions, ages, and nutrient requirements for specific population groups. Information
in the guidebook has been given based on the most recent literature reviews, food-based
dietary guidelines, and the recommendations of nutrition experts. The guidebook will be
used as a manual by the supermarket management team and is expected to provide
guidance for the implementation of healthy supermarket interventions. The research
concludes with recommendations for the retail sector that can be used to communicate
the content of the guidebook to supermarket consumers through educational
interventions, economic interventions, and by making store environment changes in the
supermarket.

The Sri Lankan financial crisis is an ongoing crisis that started in 2019. It causes near-
depletion of exchange reserves, shortage of medicine, shortage of food, shortage of food
supply, and an increase in prices of food and non-food commodities. This study focuses
on the relationship between health and wellbeing of estate households, the current
economic shocks due to crisis. The main research objective is to identify the most
important factors affecting household wellbeing during the economic crisis. Data on 100
households were collected from the Kataboola estate in Nawalapitiya by using pre-tested
structured questionnaires. The questionnaire contains both quantitative and qualitative
questions. Stratified random sampling was used to select respondents for study. Results
show that the more than half of the sampled households increased food expenditure by
more than 50%. The key concerns reported were about fuel availability, household
financial status and cleanness of drinking water. Further, regression analysis showed total
income, age of household head, protein availability shock, grain availability shock,
Vegetables availability shock, Medical expenditure and transport expenditure are related
to subjective and objective wellbeing of households. The finding of this study highlight
that encouraging and awareness programmes should be conducted for affected
households in estate sector.

Employee performance drives organizations. Literature suggests the effect of job
characteristics to enhance employee performance in organizations. The objective of this
study was to examine the impact of job characteristics on employee performance in
apparel sector organizations in Sri Lanka. Since there is lack of empirical findings in that
context this study could contribute to human resources management field. A self-
administered questionnaire was used to measure the variables of the study. Skill variety,
task identity, task significance, autonomy, feedback, social support, and psychological
job demand were considered as job characteristics in this study. A sample of 120
managerial category employees were selected from an established apparel sector
organization in Sri Lanka. Study was conducted as a case study. Results of the study were
analyzed using the Multinomial logistic regression, Man-Whitney U test and Kruskal
Wallis test. Results indicated significant positive relationships (at p&lt;0.05) between skill
variety and employee performance, task identity and employee performance, task
significance and employee performance, autonomy and employee performance,
psychological job demand and employee performance, social support by coworkers and
employee performance. There were no significant relationships (at P>0.05) between
feedback and employee performance, social support by supervisor and employee
performance, age and employee performance, experience in the current organization and
employee performance. The R2 indicated that 62% of employee performance was
explained by independents variables. Study suggests that improved job characteristics
factors contribute to improved employees’ performance in the organization.

Labeo lankae is a critically endangered freshwater fish, captively bred very recently for
conservation purposes and its larval rearing protocols are being optimized for maximum
survival. This study examined the impact of stocking density on growth indices, feed
conversion ratios, and survival of Labeo lankae fry during 42 days in captivity. A total of
1593 fry (0.1±0.001g) were collected, weighed, and stocked in 15 tanks. Each
experimental tank (cement tanks) having dimension of tank 90𝑐𝑚×70 𝑐𝑚×45𝑐𝑚 was
filled 150L of water and fry were stocked at 5 stocking densities as 0.5 fry/L (T1), 0.57
fry/L (T2), 0.66 fry/L (T3), 0.8 fry/L (T4) and 1 fry/L (T5) in triplicates. Fry were fed
with formulated feed (40% crude protein) 4 times a day. The water quality parameters
were monitored and found to be within a range suitable for freshwater aquaculture.
Significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between the various treated groups were seen at the end
of the experimental period, with T1 exhibiting the best performance through all
parameters studied, including final body weights, final body length, daily weight gain
(DWG), specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Survival rates were
not significantly (P>0.05) affected by stocking densities and were ranged from 94-97%
among all treatments. The feed conversion ratios were reported as 1.42±0.021,
1.62±0.019, 1.82±0.007, 1.88±0.106 and 1.9±0.06, respectively. The results of this study
revealed that the fry held at the lowest density of 0.5fry/L obtained the highest growth
rate, highest survival rates, and the lowest feed conversion ratio. Hence, 0.5fry/L can be
used as the best stocking density for the rearing fry of Labeo lankae in captivity.

Small-scale business prosperity, especially in challenging situations, results from many
factors. Among them, entrepreneurial strategies can be considered a primary factor. This
research explores the entrepreneurial adaptation strategies of small-scale business
operators during the COVID pandemic and the ongoing economic crisis. This study aims
to investigate small business operators' adaptation strategies and howentrepreneurial such
adaptation strategies are in the theoretical contexts of Effectuation, Causation, and
bricolage entrepreneurial decision-making behaviors. A qualitative multiple-case study
design was adopted to pursue research objectives. An individual business operator and
his/her business were treated as a case and the unit ofanalysis. The study sample was
selected from Kurunegala and Narammala areas usinga snowballing sampling technique.
In-depth interviews were conducted using a topic guide with 21 small-scale business
operators who have successfully navigated challenging situations. Furthermore, within-
case and cross-case analyses were employed to identify the patterns of entrepreneurial
processes. The findings revealed that small business operators who have successfully
navigated challenging situations have identified and capitalized on multiple opportunities
without regard to resource ownership while running multiple businesses (i.e. being
proactive). They have practiced all five principles of effectuation in their entrepreneurial
decision-making process, as opposed to the causation logic. Most of the business
operators have used the bird-in-hand principle in identifying opportunities while few
have used the patchwork quilt principle. And also, they have used bricolage selectively,
in the form of the internal, external network, and external asset bricolage in their decision-
making process. Many have used external bricolage, and no one has used parallel
bricolage inthe decision-making process. Almost all the respondents have used more than
one decision-making approach to thrive during crises. The findings reveal that
entrepreneurial strategies were necessary for business operators to navigate challenging
situations successfully.

Department of Agricultural Economics and Business Management,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
The Fisheries sector is categorized into three subsectors i.e. coastal, offshore, and
inlandfisheries. Inland fisheries are defined as exploiting fishery resources from the
inland water environment. Vavunikulam is one of the largest tanks in the Mullaitivu
district, Northern Province, Sri Lanka. It has huge potential for inland fishing. This
study aims todetermine the level of technical efficiency and identify factors affecting
the technical efficiency of small-scale fishing households. This study also focuses on
the role of the National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka (NAQDA)
and the role of thefishing society in this study area. Data on 50 fishermen were collected
from Ampalpuramvillage by using well-structured questionnaires. A Cobb-Douglas
stochastic frontier approach with an inefficiency model was used to estimate the
technical efficiency and identify the determinants of the efficiency of fishermen. The
maximum likelihood parameter estimates showed that fishing output was positively
and significantly influenced by the number of fishing gear and duration of fishing. It
implies that there is a possibility to increase fish output level if fishermen can
efficiently use inputs. The results revealed that 69.80% of the deviation from fishing
output was due to technical inefficiency. The estimated mean of technical efficiency
of the sample fishermen was about to 86%, which means there is a possibility to
increase the level of technical efficiency by 14% through efficiently utilizing the
existing resources. Further results showed that education level, experience, and income
from other sources were found to have a negative and significant effect on technical
inefficiency, and age was found to have a positive and significant effect on technical
inefficiency of fishing output. Therefore, government and policymakers should take
necessary actions and foster policies to improve the technical efficiency of fishermen
through providing formal as well as informal education, training programs, and credit
facilities.

Forests are a significant aspect of nature that deliver ecosystem services for the
betterment of living beings. Most ecosystem services of forest are unquantified in
monetary terms due to the unavailability of direct market values. The study is conducted
based on the economics of ecosystem and biodiversity framework to recognize,
demonstrate and capture the values of forests with reference to Hanthana forest range.
The two main objectives of the study are to determine the relationships among ecosystem
services, demographic data and reforestation choice and to determine the costs and
benefits of reforestation scenarios. The study population consists of three main segments;
Villagers (Uda-peradeniya, Mawelawaththa), undergraduates (University of Peradeniya)
and related stakeholders (around the Hanthana forest). The study sample consists of 85
respondents identified through convenience sampling. Face to face interviews guided by
a structured questionnaire were used to obtain the primary data. The survey data were
analyzed using descriptive analysis, multiple regression modelling and probit regression
modelling. Benefit-cost analysis was conducted to obtain the economics of reforestation
for three scenarios: ecotourism site, primary forest and participatory forest. Study
revealed that the educational level of the respondents and the type of the respondent have
significant (p&lt;0.05) relationships with the expected ecosystem services. Gender and
status of employment have significant (p&lt;0.05) relationships with reforestation choice.
The study revealed the average benefit-cost ratios for ecotourism site, primary forest and
participatory forest are 0.865(±0.462), 2.233(±0.101) and 6.20(±2.509) respectively. The
study serves as a feasibility study of comparative merits between reforestation project
and community participation.

This study was designed to develop an allometric equation to estimate the above-ground
(AGB), below-ground (BGB), and total biomass (TB) of tea, and the carbon stocks of tea
grown in organic and conventional systems in the Uva region of Sri Lanka.
Measurements are collar circumference and diameter (CDSL) at soil level, collar
circumference and diameter at 6 cm height from soil level (CDSH) to beginning of
primary branch, number of primary branches, circumference and diameter of the
beginning of primary branches, circumference and diameter of the end of the primary
branches and length of primary branches. Allometric equations were developed with the
AGB, BGB and TB and these parameters, and the best-fitted equation was selected by
Pearson correlation coefficient and simple linear regression. Using this equation, the
AGB, BGB and TB in each selected tea land was estimated. Carbon stock was considered
to be 50% of the biomass. The significance of differences between the two systems were
analyzed using two sample t test. CDSH had the best (P ˂ 0.05) correlation coefficient in
both fresh weight and dry weight basis with AGB BGB and TB in fresh weight basis.
The determined allometric equations in fresh weight basis were; AGB = 741.222 ×
CDSH(R2=0.972), BGB = 351.600 × CDSH(R2=0.946) and TBM = 822.822 ×
CDSH(R2=0.980). Determined allometric equations in dry weight basis were AGB =
226.716 × CDSH (R2 = 0.955), BGB = 153.675 × CDSL (R2 = 0.950) and TB =
377.390 × CDSH (R2 = 0.950). There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the AGB,
BGB and TB, and the carbon stocks of tea plants between the organic and conventional
systems. The results indicate that tea plants cultivated in both systems are equally capable
of sequestering the atmospheric carbon.

In Sri Lanka, tea is commonly grown as an intensive cultivation, organically &amp;
conventionally. In the present study, shade tree diversity and the biomass of shade trees
were estimated, and compared between organic and conventional tea systems in Uva
region of Sri Lanka. Fifteen organic and fourteen conventional tea fields were selected
for the study, which were either smallholders (SH) or medium/ large estates (> 10Acres).
In each field, an area of approximately 0.1 ha land was demarcated and a tree survey was
conducted, beginning with species identification. For all the lands, Shannon-Wiener and
Simpson Diversity Indices were calculated. The total, above (AGB) - and below-ground
(BGB) biomass of each shade tree was calculated as follows: For high-shade trees,
allometric equations (species specific equations wherever available, otherwise common
equations) were used, and for medium shade trees, manual method and species-specific
allometric equations were used. For the data analysis Nested experimental design was
used. The Shanon Weiner Index of organic tea lands exhibited a significantly higher (p
&lt;0.05) diversity in the organic (ORG) lands compared to the conventional (CONV)
systems. There was no significant difference between smallholder and medium/ large
scale farmers nested within each tea cultivation system. However, the Simpson Diversity
Index showed no significant difference between organic and conventional tea system at
(p&lt;0.05) level of significance. Further, there were no differences in AGB/ BGB/ total
biomass and carbon stocks between organic and conventional systems. Within the ORG
farms, the AGB/ BGB/ total biomass and carbon stocks were significantly (p &lt; 0.05)
higher in ML compared to SH, which was not evident in the CONV, and the difference
was identified occurring due to old shade trees in one estate. In conclusion, ORG and
CONV lands exhibit differences in biodiversity, total biomass, AGB and BGB, which
could be attributed to differences in the management of each plantation.
Key words: Biomass, Carbon stocks, Conventional tea cultivation, Organic, Tree

The Forest Department of Sri Lanka experimented six methods in 2015 to establish a
feasible and sustainable aproach in converting Pinus (Pinus caribaea) plantations to
natural vegetation at Kahagala Research Block in Kamburupitiya forest range of
Sinharaja World Heritage. Evaluated treatments were undisturbed Pinus plantation with
regeneration (T1), ring-barked of Pinus trees with old regeneration (T2), newly planted
stand with Dipterocarpus spp. and mixture of indigenous species after clear felling of
Pinus and other vegetation (T3), natural succession without any disturbances over 7 years
(T4), natural succession and patches has cleared around regenerating plants annually over
7 years (T5), natural succession and patches has cleared around regenerating plants and
low slashing annually (T6). Six treatments were assessed after seven years from
establishment by stand density, basal area, diameter classes and height class distribution,
species diversity, and cost estimation to implement the treatments. Means and standard
errors of variables were estimated as descriptive statistics. Treatments with old
regeneration and Pinus stands were always better than younger stands in terms of
diversity, stand structure. In T3, the stands were replanted with Dipterocarpus species
and indigenous species, which was a less-successful restoration method. The diversity
and stand density was low in T2 which could be due to damages to other trees caused
during the felling period of dead Pinus trees. In T1 and T4, competition was high because
Pinus trees are available in T1 and there are no management practices in T4; hence
competition is high in T4. Management in T6 and T5 methods, tree stand density, stand
structure, biodiversity, and cost of treatments are better than the others. As of the data, it
is recommended to accelerate natural regeneration by felling of Pinus trees without clear
felling of entire area, or take pines timber with least damage to natural vegetation or leave
Pinus for natural death.

Homegarden is defined as a complex sustainable land use system that combines multiple
farming components, such as annual and perennial crops, livestock and occasional
fishing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the differences in species composition
between wet zone and dry zone homegardens. Thirty homegardens from each site
selected for the study. Sites were selected from Galgamuwa in the Kurunegala district
and mid country wet zone areas in the Kandy district. A vegetation survey was conducted
in two Grama Niladari divisions in Galgamuwa divisional secretariat division and
Gannoruva, Kulugammana, Galagedara GN divisions in the Kandy district. In addition
to vegetation survey, a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect household
information. Homegrdens in Kandy recorded 46 species whereas it was 27 in the dry zone
homegardens. Result shows that coconut is the most dominant tree species in both dry
zone (RIV=0.326) and wet zone (RIV=0.236) homegardens evaluated under present
study. Jack and Mango was also among 10 most dominant species recorded at both sites.
Homgardens in Kandy recorded two spice species, Nutmeg and clove among 10 most
dominant species.

Exploring Cost-effective and Non-hazardous Options for Dormancy
Breaking and Germination Induction of Selected Weed Seed Species
Present in Coir Pith Blocks, Manufactured by the Exporters in the Coconut
Triangle, Sri Lanka, for Phytosanitory Certification Purposes at NPQS

Weed seed contaminations are unavoidable in coir pith-based products (CP)
manufactured by the exporters in the coconut triangle of Sri Lanka. Inefficiency and low
success rate of the regular ‘Grow Out’ test used for detecting the viable weed seeds
present in export-ready CP is the key challenge in timely-issuance of phytosanitory
certificate by the National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS) of Sri Lanka. This study was
conducted to test cost-effective, non-hazardous, and efficient alternatives to the H2SO4
pre-treatment (the most successful for the target species so far) for breaking dormancy
and inducing germination of few troublesome weed seed species present in CP, namely
Urena lobata (UL), Cenchrus echinatus (CE); Cassia occidentalis (CO), and to re-test
the most effective alternative on Chrysopogon aciculatus (CA) and Stachytarpheta
indica (SI). Scarified and non-scarified seeds (n=30*2) of each species were treated with
H2SO4 (control), acetic acid, KNO3, vinegar, coconut water, and distilled water (blank
control) for 10, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, followed by 24-hour soaking in water. Treated
seeds were germinated on wet filter papers and/or coir substrate in Petri dishes at
laboratory conditions for 14 days. Germinated and non-germinated seed count was
recorded, followed by a Tetrazolium test to check the viability of non-germinated seeds.
Final germination percentage (GP), mean germination time (MGT), germination index
(GI), and non-germinated viable seeds percentage (via) were calculated. Results showed
that the most effective treatment combination for viable CE and CO seeds was using
“vinegar for 30 min pre-treatment + 24-hour water-soaking + scarification” (GP and GI
>60%, MGT = 1-3 days; p&lt; 0.05). This treatment combination also resulted in GP and
GI of >45% for weeds CA and SI with the lowest MGT in coir substrate ({&lt;0.05).
However, vinegar pre-treatment was not effective for test parameters of UL (P>0.05) and
warrants further research.

Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are experiencing widespread
impact from Covid-19, the Easter bomb attack, and the recent economic crisis. To reduce
the negative effect of multiple crises on the performance of the sector, the identification
of factors that contribute to the growth of MSMEs is paramount importance. The
objective of this study is to examine the effect of socio-demographic characteristics of
the owner, firm characteristics, and environmental factors namely access to information,
social support, and government support in determining the growth of the business. Survey
and informal interviews were conducted using a self- structured questionnaire to collect
the primary data from the owners of 80 MSMEs in the retail sector operations in the
Trincomalee district. The study revealed that 76% of sampled MSMEs have recorded
growth in their business during the last 5 years. As theresult of binary logistic regression
analysis suggested, firm age, access to information,and government support drive the
business growth of MSMEs (P&lt;0.05). This researchrecommends that the government can
introduce new loan schemes and new incentivesto help the MSMEs sector and also the
government can introduce new technologies tostrengthen information transfer between
MSMEs and government sources and researchinstitutions that support business growth.
This finding could be useful for governments,NGOs, and policymakers to design targeted
policies and programs to develop the MSMEs sector.

Banks are facing the challenge of a global recession. The objective of the study was to
identify the decision-making styles of branch managers in private sector banks and to
determine the effect of perceived stress, self-efficacy, and heuristics on the decision-
making styles. Branch managers of private sector banks in the central province were
selected as the study population. Banks were stratified into categories based on the
financial assets owned by respective banks. Five banks were selected using stratified
purposive sampling and 72 branch managers were selected accordingly. A self-
administered survey was conducted together with key informant interviews. Results of
the study were analyzed using the Multinomial logistic regression, spearmen correlation,
and Kruskal Wallis test. Majority of the respondents (51.39%) practice rational decision-
making style as the dominant decision-making style. Self-efficacy of branch managers
has a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.01) with dependent and intuitive decision-making
styles. Perceived stress of branch managers significantly correlated with the avoidant and
spontaneous decision-making styles (p &lt; 0.01). Self-efficacy of branch managers has a
significant effect on all of decision making styles (p &lt; 0.05). However, perceived stress
did not indicate a significant effect on intuitive decision-making style. It has effected all
of other decision-making styles (p &lt; 0.05). Availability heuristic indicated a significant
effect on rational and intuitive decision-making styles (p &lt; 0.05). Identifying the
decision-making styles and individual differences assist the management to develop
effective training programmes for employees. It serves to avoid biases in making routine
and strategic decisions in organizations.

This research aims to identify the diet quality, the factors affecting diet quality and the
coping strategies adopted during the economic crisis and food inflation in Sri Lanka. The
study was conducted in Kandy district targeting rural, urban, and estate areas. A
questionnaire survey was carried out with a sample size of 100. Multiple linear
regressions, descriptive statistics and graphical analysis were carried out. Diet quality
was calculated as a percentage of daily carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin and mineral
intake from the recommended level. As factors affecting diet quality gender, income,
living area, household size, source of food, food budget share, health condition, and food
preference were considered in the regression analysis. The results found that income has
a significant positive relationship with diet quality (P&lt; 0.05). Rural people show a higher
level of consumption in carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and minerals compared to
urban and estate people. Estate people show the lowest nutrient intake. All the three areas
show higher carbohydrate consumption beyond the recommended level. However, all
other nutrients are consumed in lower levels than the recommended level. As coping
strategies most of the people have stopped consuming expensive food items and shifted
to cheaper alternatives and also have reduced the nonfood expenditures to fulfill the food
requirement. The diet quality of estate people is the most affected during the economic
crisis. Diet qualities of all people have been affected during the economic crisis and hence
they are unable to fulfill their daily nutrient requirement. Consuming excessive
carbohydrate and an imbalanced diet could result in serious health problems in the future.
Therefore, programs should be implemented to introduce balanced diets to cope up
during the economic crisis.

Agriculture Extension service plays a vital role to provide farmers knowledge, skills and
attitude. It bridges the information gap between farmers and Agriculture research
institutes. The job engagement of extension officers plays an effective role to have a
productive outcome. The study was aimed to examine the factors contributing to the
employee engagement of agricultural extension officers. It further examined the effect of
factors on different elements of employee engagement. A thorough literature review
indicated job autonomy, social support by supervisor, employee training, work life
balance, and non-monitory rewards as factors associated with the employee engagement
of agricultural instructors. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect primary
data of 100 agriculture instructors in Provincial department of Agriculture, Central
Province (Kandy, Matale and Nuwara-Eliya district). Results of the study were analyzed
using descriptive and inferential analyses, namely; Multinomial logistic regression, Man-
Whitney u test, and Kruskal Wallis test. Results of the study revealed non-monetary
reward, and supervisory support (at P&lt;; 0.1) contributes to employee engagement of
agriculture instructors. Employee training, work life balance, and non-monetary rewards
did not indicate significant relationships with job engagement of employees. There was
no relationship between employee engagement and demographic factors such as gender,
age, education status, and work experience. About 45% of employee engagement was
explained by above independents variables. The focus group discussions with agriculture
instructors suggested that lack of clarity of job roles has a negative impact on their level
of job engagement. Addressing above factors contribute to upgrade the employees’
engagement of Agriculture Instructors.

Department of Agricultural Economics and Business Management,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
The GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) program has been initiated by the Department of
Agriculture (DOA) as a solution for the overuse of fertilizer and agrochemicals while
increasing the production and marketing standards of agricultural commodities. Although
the GAP has been given wide publicity, the issues faced by GAP producers have not been
evaluated. Therefore, this study investigates the perception of GAP producers, factors
affecting the level of adoption of GAP practices, achievement of intended outcomes by
GAP producers, and technical efficiency (TE) of GAP producers. The necessary data was
collected by surveying a random sample of 33 GAP farmers who cultivate snake guard,
long bean, salad cucumber, and capsicum. The GAP farmers’ perception was analyzed
using descriptive analysis. GAP farmers have a positive perception of the overall benefits
of the GAP program, income, farmgate price, and attraction of new markets, and a
negative perception of financial support. The factors affecting to adoption level were
analyzed by multiple linear regression. The information received and training received
from DOA had a significant relationship with the adoption level of GAP. Of the surveyed
GAP producers, 80% of snake guard, 71% of long bean 100% of salad cucumber and
capsicum had lower costs of production compared to the DOA estimates. The TE is
analyzed by stochastic frontier analysis. The technical efficiency ranged between 0.31 to
0.99 and the mean TE was 0.79 implying that there is a 21% scope of increasing the
production without any additional inputs. The technical efficiency has been affected by
the level of adoption and number of meetings per year with officers of DOA. The findings
are useful for the further development of the SL-GAP program.

Vegetable cultivation is an important subsector in the agriculture sector in Sri Lanka.
However, traditional vegetable supply chains are affected by many inefficiencies due to
long food miles which lead to high postharvest losses. This research explores the option
of using a mobile application to develop linkages among various stakeholders in the
vegetable supply chain and to create new market opportunities to address the existing
inefficiencies. Due to the complexity of the supply chain and the involvementof several
stakeholders it is of utmost importance to look at the stakeholder’s intentionto adopt such
a technology before its introduction to the market. Therefore, the objective of this study
is to identify factors that affect stakeholder’s intention to adopt,identify how age affects
intention to adopt and the stakeholder intention to adapt to the proposed mobile
application. The research identified producers, consumers, delivery riders, wholesalers,
retailers, and commission agents as the stakeholders in the vegetable supply chain. The
Extended Technology Adoption Model was used to conceptualize the research. Perceived
usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived trust,perceived cost, subjective norms, and
perceived risk are the independent factors and intention to adopt was the dependent
variable. Primary data were gathered through a questionnaire across five stakeholder
categories at the Dambulla Dedicated EconomicCentre and the data of consumer category
were collected through e-questionnaire. Sampling method is convenience sampling. All
the results were calculated and analyzed through the smart pls, Amos and SPSS
respectively. The findings show a significant positive relationship between perceived
usefulness, subjective norms, and perceived ease of use in terms of stakeholders’
intention to adopt mobile applications,while an insignificant relationship was identified
with perceived ease of use, trust, age,and cost.

Department of Animal Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya
The dairy sector is prominent among all the livestock sub-sectors primarily due to its
influence on the rural economy. This study focuses on evaluating the extensive
production system of cattle in Thuppitiyawa and Siyabalagaswewa villages in
Anuradhapura district, and assess the perception of farmers on changing to a semi-
intensive farming system as an adaptive option to changing climate. The study also
included the evaluation of the climate smartness of such a change by employing a score
card system, collectively developed by the Market Oriented Dairy project, Department
of Animal Production and Health and International Union for Conservation of Nature.
The score card quantified farm level climate smartness related to farm management,
animal welfare and comfort, land and water management and emission management. A
total of 31 dairy farmer selected by purposive sampling were surveyed for the willingness
to change into semi-intensive system using a structured questionnaire, and the data were
descriptively analysed. According to the study, irrespective to the age and educational
level, 75% of farmers were willing to shift to the semi-intensive system, and 32% of
farmers are willing to invest on developing shelters according to the climate-smart
specifications proposed by the study. Moreover, the study revealed that, lack of
awareness on improved fodder verities and key management steps such as keeping
correct herd composition, night shelter and providing ad-lib drinking water are
significantly influencing the milk production in those herds. The assessment of climate
smartness using the score card revealed that 68% of farms could achieve at least 30% of
climate smart criteria tested. The study concluded that with appropriate and timely
technical assistance, the farmers in the area have a potential and capacity to shift towards
climate-smart dairy systems for low-carbon milk production.

The Mottapeththewa cascade system is located in the Galgamuwa area of theKurunegala
District. The depletion of vegetation cover, soil erosion, and the recession of the water
table are some issues emblematic in many catchments including the Mottapeththewa
cascade system. The objectives of this study are, to estimate the factors affecting the
intention of farmers to engage in groundwater recharging and management practices, and
to estimate the factors affecting farmers’ engagement in groundwater recharging and
management practices. A field survey was conducted using a questionnaire. The
descriptive statistics indicate that more than half of the sample had training on
groundwater recharging. The conceptual framework based on the Technology
Acceptance Model consists of 7 constructs such as (i) result demonstrability, (ii) self-
efficacy, (iii) perceived usefulness, (iv) perceived ease of use, (v) attitude, (vi) intention,
and (vii) demographic factors. According to the results of the Structural Equation Model,
result demonstrability and perceived usefulness have an indirect effect on intention
(P&lt;0.05) while attitude and perceived usefulness have a direct effect on intention
(P&lt;0.05). A multivariate probitmodel was conducted to find the factors affecting farmers’
engagement in groundwater recharging practices. The results revealed that the practice
of percolation pits is affected by education, farming experience, land area, training on
groundwater recharging, annual and perennial crop types, and home gardening(P&lt;0.05).
Constructing percolation wells is affected by the farming experience, landarea, training,
vegetables, and field crops (P&lt;0.1). The practice of lock and spill drainis affected by home
gardening, perennials, and manual irrigation (P&lt;0.1). Home gardening, field crops, and
manual irrigation affect practicing runoff water harvestingtrenches (P&lt;0.1). The practice
of organic mulching is affected by education, annuals,and vegetable crop type (P&lt;0.1).
The findings of the study imply that farmers’ engagement in groundwater recharging
practices is affected by different farm and demographic factors.

This study was conducted to evaluate the nutritional and botanical composition of
underutilized pastures under coconut lands in Coconut Research Institute (CRI), Sri
Lanka and to assess the financial feasibility of Jamnapari goat integration into these
pastures. Naturally grown (uncultivated) and improved (cultivated) pasture samples were
collected from coconut lands in Bandirippuwa and Makandura estates, respectively.
Improved pasture varieties were Brachiaria brizantha, Brachiaria ruziziensis
and Brachiaria milliformis. Quadrat cut samples were taken randomly and analysed for
the dry matter availability (kg/ha), Crude Protein (CP %) and Crude Fibre (CF %).
Feasibility analysis was carried out based on of average dry matter yields and respective
carrying capacities of pastures and related production and market data. In natural and
improved pastures, mean dry matter yields varied from 2141±193 kg/ha to 3314±212
kg/ha and from 4231±407 kg/ha to 9152±531 kg/ha, respectively. The CP % and CF %
varied from 6.31±0.29% to 18.51±0.22% and from 30.07±0.48% to 33±0.39%,
respectively. Grass and legume percentages of natural and improved pastures varied from
1.97% to 66.38% and 7.03% to 83.91%, respectively. Estimated Jamnapari goat carrying
capacities for natural and improved pastures were 8-11 heads/ha and 24-27 heads/ha,
respectively including does, kids, and a buck. The Net Present Value for the coconut
monoculture system was around LKR 0.441 million whereas, for integrated systems with
natural and improved pastures, it was LKR 1.432 and LKR 4.689 million, respectively at
a 15% discount rate for 10 years. Feasibility and profitability estimates increased in the
order of Coconut monoculture, Coconut-Natural pasture-Goat integration and Coconut-
Improved pasture-Goat integration.

The current economic crisis in Sri Lanka has challenged the food and nutritional security
of people, especially people who live in the estate sector. Though a few researches have
assessed the vulnerability of certain communities, vulnerability of the estate sector,
specially rubber and coconut dwellers has not been assessed so far. Against this
background, the objective of this study is to assess the vulnerability of estate people to
food and nutrition security using Coping Strategy Index (CSI) developed by Care
International and World Food Program. The study collected data using a semi-structured
questionnaire and a focus group discussion from a sample of estate workers in Lavant
estate drawn using proportionate stratified random sample method. Subsequently
determinants of coping strategy index examined using a linear regression analysis. To
explore an association between Household Dietary Diversity Score and CSI correlation
technique was used. The results revealed that eating less preferred food and cutting
portion size were the mostly adapted strategies by households in both coconut and rubber
sectors. Coping strategy index had a significantly negative relationship with sector and
the income while significantly positive relationship with dependency ratio (p&lt;0.05).
Drastic reduction of the consumption of imported food items such as milk and wheat was
noted. These findingsstress the importance of strengthening the social safety net to reduce
food and nutritionimplication of the economic crisis.

Fishing in inland reservoirs is carried out by community-based organizations. The
success of community-based management is conditional upon the institutional robustness
of the organization that governs fisheries management. The strength of fisheries
community organizations depends heavily on the mutually respect, connectedness and
trustworthiness among the fishers. Social capital is a measure of this. The objective of
this research is to assess the institutional robustness of five selected medium perennial
reservoirs. Institutional robustness was assessed by examining the degree of compliance
with Ostrom’s design principles. Furthermore, the study assessed the association between
institutional robustness and social capital. The social capital was measured by
considering social network and groups, social cohesion, trust and solidarity, collective
action, information and communication, empowerment and political action. The result
suggests that there was a diversity among the selected reservoirs on institutional
robustness though fisheries organizations in all medium perennial reservoirs compiled
with all the 11 modified design principles except “clearly defined user boundaries”.
Institutional robustness is high in the community-based organization of Irakkamam
reservoir, it complied well with Ostrom’s design principles and had an average value of
77.3 for social capital. There is a significant (p&lt;0.05) association between institutional
robustness and social capital in the community. To improve institutional robustness, it is
important to enhance the social capital of the community. Weak institutions should
rebuild their organization with new effective administrative committee and should need
to follow the aspects practicing in robust institutions.

Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Antibiotics are one of the most significant groups of secondary metabolites that have
been used to treat diseases. Soil dwelling microorganisms have been studied extensively
to identify those who could produce antibiotics. This study was carried out to isolate
antibiotic producing bacteria from soil and compost samples and to characterize those
isolates. Potential antibiotic producing bacteria were isolated from soil and compost
samples using crowded plate technique and the isolates were tested against three different
group of sensitive microorganisms, namely; (1) unidentified sensitive bacteria that were
isolated from the same soil and compost sample (2) two pathogenic test bacteria with
known antibiotic sensitivity profiles [Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923)], and (3) phosphorus solubilizing bacteria isolated
from soil (Pseudomonas marginalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus pacificus,
Lysinibacillus spaericus, Staphylococcus warneri, Stenotrophomonas sp., Bacillus sp.,
Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis). Antimicrobial screening was carried out by using
streak agar plate method and inhibition zone method. Out of 13 isolates, 8 isolates caused
inhibition of the growth of one or more sensitive bacteria. Two bacterial isolates (A2 and
A5) caused a wide spectrum of inhibition against test bacteria. Isolate A2 inhibited the
growth of some microorganisms (A2R, A4R and A5R), Bacillus pacificus and
Lysinibacillus spaericus in streak agar method. The results obtained from streak agar
plate method and inhibition zone methods were not consistent. Isolate A5 caused
inhibition against some sensitive soil bacteria (A2R and B1R) and Acinetobacter
baumannii, Stenotrophomonas sp, Bacillus sp., in streak agar method. The result of
present study revealed that identified antibiotic producing bacteria did not inhibit the
activity of pathogenic test bacteria (E.coli and S. aureus), but inhibited the growth of
some unidentified bacteria used in this study.

Among the native flora of Sri Lanka, more than 1,400 plants are used in indigenous
medicine for treating illnesses for over a thousand years. However, due to degradation of
natural vegetation and unsustainable human activities, most of the native medicinal plants
have lost their natural habitats. The commercial cultivation of native medicinal plants is
also restricted to a few species. Though taxonomic information is available, the
distributional ecology of native medicinal plants has not been studied adequately. The
mapping of geographical distribution will provide the basis for study, conservation, and
utilization as well as understanding the cultivation requirements. The based document
was developed referring to 16 volumes of the flora of Ceylon and available checklists for
Sri Lankan plants. It includes 12,450 localities of 983 species of medicinal plants. Based
on that, the distribution pattern of native medicinal plants was mapped using QGIS
software and Arc GIS software. Ten native species were selected based on records of the
Export Development Board. A checklist of native medicinal plants was prepared. The list
consists of 1059 species including 172 endemic species. Distributional maps were
developed for 983 species and endemic species, separately. According to the Average
Nearest Neighbor Analysis, species show clustered distribution patterns, and leading into
hotspots for both native and endemic groups. Giving the Z-Scores; -124.89 and -50.54,
there is a less than 1% likelihood that these clustered patterns of all species and endemic
species could be the result of random chance, respectively. Nearly 58% of species have
been distributed in the Kandy district followed by Ratnapura (36%) and Matale (34%).
The distribution, climatic and soil maps were prepared for ten selected species aiming for
commercial cultivation. The study provides required information for the study,
conservation, and sustainable utilization of native medicinal plant species in Sri Lanka.

Kandyan homegardens is a well-established and culturally important land use system
found in the mid country wet zone especially in and around the Kandy district. This study
aims to investigate the occupation of Nutmeg in Kandyan homegardens and their impact
on the biodiversity by comparing the species diversity of homegardens that are having
and not having Nutmeg trees. The study evaluated a total of 48 homegardens in Kandy
district which are having and not having Nutmeg by estimating relative height, relative
DBH, relative density and relative frequency for calculating Relative Importance Value
(RIV) for plant species. The results showed that RIV value for nutmeg is 14.54 in the
homegardens that have selected for study as nutmeg is present in them. RIV values of
coconut, hawarinuga, clove, aricanut, mahogany, mango, avocado and rambutan are
higher in homegardens that do not have nutmeg trees. When Nutmeg shows some
dominance, RIV of the other species have decreased substantially. It is observed that
Nutmeg suppresses and eliminates other tree species from the homegarden as it grows
bigger. People place a lot of care on Nutmeg as they have emerged as one of the main
species providing cash to the farmers and hence they don’t thin or prune them.

Perception of a Balanced Diet and Food Consumption Patterns of
University Undergraduates: The Case of the University of Peradeniya

Department of Agricultural Economics and Business Management,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
With the prevailing economic crisis, high food inflation was at an estimated 86.4% year-
on-year in October 2022. During the crisis, university students are highly vulnerable as
they live away from home and have limited funds to fulfil their dietary needs. However,
just as the economic crisis can affect their food intake, so can undergraduates’ general
tendency to be unconcern over diet. Therefore, the extent to which their diet results from
the economic crisis is unclear. This research studies university students’ perceptions of a
balanced diet and food consumption patterns. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was used
as the theoretical foundation to conduct a survey of students attached to the University of
Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. A sample of 450 students participated in the study. Results
revealed that students with a better financial status were mainly from urban areas and had
a higher intention to eat a balanced diet. They also had higher consumption of protein-
rich foods, and fruits, which are usually more expensive. Students with low financial
capacity had less intention to take a balanced diet and lower consumption of protein-rich
foods and fruits. Students staying at boarding places had the highest monthly expenses
and monthly food expenses. The fact that food is cheaper at university canteens than
outside explains the trend. Students from home had the highest consumption of legumes,
meat, milk, and fruits. They had the lowest monthly expenses for food. However, the
intention to take a balanced diet did not vary with accommodations. Attitudes and
perceived behavioural control were major factors affecting the intention to take a
balanced diet (P&lt;0.05), while subjective norms did not significantly affect intention
(P>0.05). Furthermore, the research found that the sociodemographic factors of ethnicity,
area of residence and gender influenced students’ attitudes, subjective norms, and
perceived behavioural control (P&lt;0.05).

Department of Animal Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
The overall objective of this study was to assess the perception of undergraduates of the
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya on selected dairy calf and cow
management practices and welfare, and to assess the knowledge and awareness of
undergraduates on dairy calf and cow welfare. The specific objective was, to investigate
the factors affecting the perception. The survey was conducted using 357 undergraduate
students representing three-degree programs who were in their first to final year. The
survey was categorized into 6 main groups; demographic factors, eating habits of
undergraduates, relationship with animals, and knowledge, perception, and attitudes on
selected management practices. Data were collected through a google form
questionnaire. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS). The one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis and
Pearson correlation tests were used to study the relationship between perception and
independent variables. According to the results, the majority of undergraduates
participated in the survey were females (52%) and the rest were males (48%).
Undergraduates’ perception on calf and cow management practices and welfare were
significantly affected by degree programs (P&lt;0.05), gender (P&lt;0.05), and experience
with rearing dairy cattle (P&lt;0.05). Undergraduates’ academic year, religion, area of
origin, and eating habits did not significantly affect their perception. According to the
results of correlation matrix, knowledge, perception, and attitudes were correlated
(P&lt;0.01). The majority of undergraduates participated in the survey (61%) were aware
of key dairy calf and cow management practices and welfare. However, most of the
responses with respect to perception on management practices and welfare were ‘neither
agree or disagree’. It is suggested that perception related to key dairy calf and cow
management practices and welfare should be improved, possibly through better learning
opportunities.

Compost is a cheap source of plant nutrients and a soil amendment. Management of
kitchen waste (KW) is a challenging task due to reasons such as development of
unacceptable odor and house flies. Black soldier fly (BSF)-aided composting of KW can
minimize the challenges mentioned previously; hence, this study was conducted with the
objective of determining the potential of BSF larvae for rapid composting of KW.
Combination of vegetable waste (VW) and fish wastes (FW) was taken as treatments,
simulating KW, with and without BSF larvae. After 15 days, amount of compost in
treatments was measured, and compost percentage was calculated on a dry weight basis.
In addition, survival of BSF larvae in treatments and effect of temperature on survival of
pupae were examined. Composting percentage was significantly different (F (5, 18) =27.8
P&lt;0.05) among the treatments (5-79%). The highest composting percentage (79%) was
found in the treatment; vegetable and fish waste (1:1) (VFW) with BSF larvae. The least
composting percentage was found in VW (5%) without BSF larvae. Adding of BSF
larvae has a significant (P&lt;0.05) effect on composting. The interaction between media
and presence/absence of larvae was not significant (P>0.05). There was a significant
difference among (F (2, 27) =186 P&lt;0.05) the three media in relation to BSF larvae survival;
the highest survival (43.9±0.6) was in VFW followed by VW (33.8±0.9) and FW
(24.2±0.5). Temperatures (26-34 °C) significantly (P&lt;0.05) affected the survival of BSF
larvae. The highest survival rate was found at 30 °C. Based on the results, it can be
concluded that vegetable and fish waste can be rapidly decomposed by using BSF larvae
and it is beneficial to use BSF larvae in composting.

Sri Lanka Good Agricultural Practices (SL-GAP) was introduced with the aim of
ensuring consumer safety and providing market benefits to local vegetable, fruit farmers.
This study is an attempt to determine the profitability of SL-GAP adopted capsicum and
tomato farmers and sustainability of adopting SL-GAP as a farming practice in Kandy
district of Sri Lanka. Primary data was collected from 120 farmers including 60 farmers
each from GAP-adopted and others. Stratified sampling technique was used. Mean
comparison done using paired t-test showed that there is a significant difference of net
profits of GAP and non-GAP capsicum farmers and GAP and non-GAP tomato farmers.
Multiple linear regression was estimated to identify the factors which determine the net
profit variation. Transport cost, GAP adoption and capsicum showed positive significant
(p&lt;0.05) relationship with the net profit. Inorganic fertilizer cost, labor cost, farm
maintenance cost, cost for worker’s security and welfare had a negative significant
(p&lt;0.05) relationship with the net profit. A Logistic model was estimated to analyze the
factors which determine the GAP adoption. Extension service has a positive significant
(p&lt;0.05) relationship to the GAP adoption. Qualitative analysis revealed that ensuring
safety of farm produce, receiving new techniques and knowledge, increasing the quality
of products determine the future adoption, continuation of SL-GAP program. High initial
investment, input costs, absence of a guaranteed market for SL-GAP products are the
major challenges for farmers in the Kandy district who cultivate capsicum and tomato.

The glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) are valuable indicators of carbohydrate-
rich diets that are used to assist people to manage their blood glucose levels and improve
overall health. There is a growing demand for employing healthy participants for clinical
trials in GI studies. However, there is no any commercially established, accredited GI
testing laboratory in Sri Lanka. This study was conducted to recruit and manage a healthy
human panel for clinical trials to analyze the post-prandial glycemic response of food.
Initially, 301 university undergraduate students were recruited in the age group 21-25
years, and collected anthropometric and demographic parameters. The recruited
participants were screened based on anthropometric and demographic parameters. Then
97 participants were screened and trained for clinical trials in GI studies. Finally, 50
interested and available participants were chosen as the “healthy human panel for GI
studies”. Inter-laboratory validation of GI values was conducted using the GI data
obtained by CIC Food and Nutrition Research Laboratory and Glycemic Index Research
Unit, Singapore. The healthy human panel consisted of participants aged between 22-25
years, mean body mass index (BMI) of 20.9 ± 1.7 kg/m2 and a mean waist-to-hip ratio
(WHR) of 0.8 ± 0.1. The performance of the developed healthy clinical panel was
evaluated according to ISO 26642:2010 (E). The results for the GI of super kernal, rathu
suduru, red fragrant, and purple queen rice varieties were 40 ± 5.5% (low GI), 61 ± 5.5%
(medium GI), 54 ± 3.8% (low GI), and 47 ± 4.9% (low GI) respectively. Results of inter-
laboratory validation revealed no significant difference (P>0.05) in GI values of the
selected rice varieties. Therefore, the proposed healthy human clinical panel for GI
studies can be used in future GI studies of the food industry to facilitate GI labeling of
food products.

Remediation of Copper Contaminated Soil by Char Derived from Used
Disposable Baby Diapers
Kavinthini A. and Igalavithana A.D.*
Department of Soil Science,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Plastic is an emerging soil pollutant. The increased use of single-use plastic products is
the main reason for plastic wastes. Disposable baby diapers (UDD) are one of those. Fifty
percent of its content is plastic. The degradation time of UDD can be > 100 yr. Pyrolysis
is a possible way to recycle plastic wastes. The aim of this study was to produce plastic
char from used UDD and to assess its effectiveness in using it as a soil amendment to
immobilize copper (Cu) in soil. Uncontaminated soil was spiked with copper (II) sulfate.
Based on the thermo gravimetric analysis of UDD, 550°C was selected as the pyrolysis
temperature. Produced plastic char was characterized before applying them to soil. The
contaminated soil was incubated after applying plastic char at (the rates of 0%-control, 1
and 2.5%). Immobilization of Cu was measured after one month of incubation period by
using single extraction using 1M ammonium acetate and consecutive extraction using
0.01M CaCl2 methods. The soil pH, Electrical conductivity (EC), available Na, available
Mg, available K, available P, available Ca and available N were analyzed. Based on the
consecutive extraction analysis, plastic char added treatments showed significant
(p&lt;0.05) reduction of extractable Cu concentration. The reduction was similar in soil with
the two application rates of plastic char. Properties of plastic char i.e., high pH (11.27),
high ash content (36.38%) and high EC (0.03 dS/m) could increase the soil pH thereby
facilitate Cu immobilization. The C-H, C=O, C-C and phenols-like functional groups on
the surface and high fixed C content (48.14%) of plastic char also might have supported
the immobilization of Cu. These findings indicate that derived plastic char from UDD
could be applied to immobilize Cu in contaminated soil. Pyrolyzed UDD could be an
efficient waste management practice which minimize the environmental pollution.

Risk Management Strategies Adopted by Small and Medium Scale Layer
Chicken Farmers in Kurunegala District during Economic Crisis
in Sri Lanka

Layer chicken farming was one of the fastest-growing well-developed sectors in Sri
Lanka. However, the growth of the sector was constrained by the multiple crises the
sector faced recently. The Easter bomb attack, Covid-10, and the economic crisis were
among them. These events caused input shortage, input price escalation, output price
fluctuations, and less demand for the egg. The layer chicken industry has been seen asa
risky industry at the present. In response to this, some farmers opt to leave the industrywhile
others stay in the industry by utilizing various risk management strategies. This study
aimed to identify these risk management strategies and their determinants. The study was
conducted in the Kurunegala district, which has the highest poultry population in the
country. The Snow-balling sampling technique was utilized to selectthe farmers. A pre-
tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 68 farmers. Datawere analyzed using
descriptive analysis and binary logit regression. The study found that farmers are well
prepared for the risk posed by pests and diseases and less preparedfor marketing risks.
Hence, 28-layer farmers have temporarily exited the industry. However, healthy risk
management strategies, such as giving a low-cost nutritious diet,and pre-purchasing inputs
practiced to address new risks that emerged from 2019. Small-scale farmers (P&lt;0.1) and
risk-averse farmers (P&lt;0.05) were found to be the ones who chose to leave the industry
temporarily. The study stresses the importance of immediate interventions to support
small-scale layer farmers to survive the crisis to ensure the long-term sustainability of the
industry.

Tropical regions receive great amount of solar radiation, affecting thermal energy
increment. Shade trees play an essential role in changing microclimate by manipulating
radiation energy that supports the survival of plants and people. This study compares the
effectiveness of Messua ferrea L., Muntingia calabura and Amherstia nobilis as shade
trees in landscape planning related to shade creation, radiation modification, and
microclimate modifications. In the present study, the transmittance spectrum was
measured in the 318-885 nm region using a high-resolution spectroradiometer under the
canopy of selected Mesua, Muntingia and Amherstia trees on bright sunny days. The
change in shade casting on ground during the day was modeled. In addition, the
temperature, CO2 and relative humidity were also measured. The light transmittance was
reduced when moving from the outer edge of the canopy to the trunk base in horizontal
plane in selected tree species. The irradiance levels of blue (B: 400-5000 nm), red (R:
650-680 nm), far-red (FR: 700-885 nm) and ultra violet (UV: 318-400nm) components
of the transmittance spectra under canopy were also found significantly low compared to
direct sunlight. Mesua cuts down 99% of the total spectrum and Muntingia and Amherstia
cut down the same by 92.1% and 97.1% respectively. The measured R: FR ratios that
influence growth attributes of floricultural crops of Mesua were less than 0.1 and were
0.2 and 0.6 in Amherstia and Muntingia, respectively during the midday. Under the
shaded canopy the temperature reduction was 2◦ C and 1◦ C in Mesua and Muntingia,
respectively. Mesua showed 1-2% RH increment and ~20ppm reduction in the CO2
concentration. There was no difference in RH under the tree canopy at midday in
Amherstia and Muntingia. Muntingia was found to be suitable for growing shade-loving
plants underneath their canopies and Mesua can be recommended for human comfort
specially in public places.

The waste disposal is one of the major constraints associated with swine production
because of negative environmental impact. The discharging swine manure from the
piggeries takes a long time to decompose hence generates unpleasant odor. Therefore,
objectives of the present study were to stabilize and reduce unpleasant odor of swine
manure using microbial inoculants, and to find out the most efficient application
frequency of the inoculants for accelerated stabilization. Effective microorganisms (EM)
and Live-Gro® probiotic solution were used as inoculants, after diluting 1:20 and 1:10
ratios, respectively. The inoculums were applied separately in 2-day, 1-week, and 2-week
intervals for 30 days. The control manure samples were added 5 ml water only at the
frequency and all treatments were carried out with three replicates. The physicochemical
parameters such as pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS),
salinity, Dry Matter (DM), and Volatile Solids (VS) were taken at a defined time interval.
Ammonia nitrogen, soluble nitrate nitrogen, and soluble phosphate concentrations were
measured after 14 days to assess the rate of decomposition. ANOVA and Tukey tests
were used for data analysis. Manure samples treated with EM and Live-Gro® solution at
2 days interval reached rapid stability (within 10 days) when compared to control
showing low pH and higher TDS than in the control. There was a declining trend in DM,
VS, Soluble NO3--N, and soluble NH3-N with the time of storage in all inoculated
samples which were more prominent in 2-day interval application. The samples treated
with EM at an interval of 2 days showed a significantly (p&lt;0.05) low DM (28.76%)
content and ammonia nitrogen (723.7ppm) after 28th day of inoculation. In conclusion, it
could be mentioned that the application of EM at 2-day intervals to swine manure could
efficiently stabilize and reduce unpleasant odor.

Peri-urban animal farming systems have a greater potential to contribute to the
sustainable growth of urban food systems. It strongly interacts with a mix of urban, and
rural resources in different ways and at different hierarchy levels. Improving productivity
at farm level invariably enhance the supply to the food system. This research intended
to; (1) Observe species diversity of the animal farms/mixed farms in selected peri-urban
areas, (2) Estimate the total factor productivity (TFP) of those farms, (3) Identify
determinants of productivity and (4) Outline the issues, opportunities, constraints of peri-
urban animal farming. The TFP relates the output to a bundle of inputs, such as capital,
labour, land and intermediate inputs, which were measured in this study using Fisher
index. The pretested questionnaire was administered to collect data from a total of 115
farmers, where 50, 35 and 30 from Homagama, Padukka and Kosgama veterinary ranges,
respectively. Purposive sampling technique was used to draw farmers into the sample.
TFP was calculated by considering the variable inputs, viz: labour, feeding, fuel,
veterinary, miscellaneous, and outputs; farm products and animal sales. A base farm (TFP
= 1) was selected to compare the level of productivity. The mean TFP values for 101
dairy farmers and for 15 commercial and backyard poultry farmers were 1.76 and 0.90.
The range varied between 0.04 to 5.24 (±0.1) and 0.14 to 1.33 (±0.08), respectively.
Ordinary logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of TFP variation across
farms. The results reveled that the inclusion of dhal husk and rice bran into rations,
availability of own grassland, distance to the main city, and education level of farmers
(P&lt;0.05) explain the difference in TFP value. TFP was not influenced by animal farming
experience and income.

Expectation-disconfirmation theory suggests that satisfaction from a product would be
dependent on the (dis)confirmation of the product experience with the product
expectation. This study applies the expectation-disconfirmation theory to assess the level
of satisfaction of the degree programe offered by the Faculty of Agriculture, University
of Peradeniya. A satisfied customer would spread positive word of mouth that builds the
reputation for the product offering increasing the demand. An educational institute would
have a high demand for the programs offered if they have satisfied students. The study
focused on the product offering of a degree program in terms of knowledge, skills, and
attitudes the students’ expectation on the product offering and what they experienced.
Data was collected from the final year students of the three degree programs offered by
the Faculty of Agriculture: the Agriculture Technology and Management, Food Science
and Technology and Animal Science and Fisheries using a self-administered
questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation
modeling (SEM) using Smart PLS software. The study found that there is a high level of
disconfirmation among students with regard to attitudes than with regard to skills and
knowledge. There is a significant relationship between satisfaction and confirmation of
the expected level of knowledge, skills, and attitudes through experience for all the three
degree programs, there is not significant relationship between gender and satisfaction in
all three degree programs and there is a significant relationship between CGPA and
satisfaction in Animal Science and Fisheries degree program. The study recommends that
Faculty strive to understand what the expectation of the prospective students, organize a
curriculum and delivery of the of the degree programs to focusing on delivery to meet
the students' expectations.

Online freelancers have the potential to earn foreign currencies while working from
home. However, they are an understudied segment of the labour force in Sri Lanka. In
this study, the effects of need fulfilment and entrepreneurial orientation on the
progression of the freelancing career were studied, based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of
Needs Theory. No sampling frame was available as the freelancing population in Sri
Lanka is not defined. Hence, convenient and snowball sampling techniques were used.
Responses were obtained through a questionnaire distributed in social media
communities dedicated to freelancers. There, the effect of freelancers’ satisfaction with
the level of need fulfilment on their willingness to progress as a freelancer and the
moderating effect of individual entrepreneurial orientation on that relationship were
analysed. Further, Maslow’s finding that the fulfilment of lower-level needs affects the
fulfilment of higher-level needs was checked here. A pyramid score was calculated to
obtain overall satisfaction of needs. Within the sample, only 51% showed a hierarchy in
fulfilling needs. Ordinal logistic regression and correlation tests were used in the analysis.
Results indicated that there is a significant relationship between satisfaction with need
fulfilment and willingness to progress in the freelance career for both the freelancers who
follow the hierarchical order and the entire sample (without taking the hierarchy into
account). When taken individually, none of the five need types (physiological, security,
belongingness, esteem and self-actualization needs) had a significant effect on the
willingness to progress in the freelancing career. In any case, entrepreneurial orientation
had no moderating effect on the relationship between freelancers’ need fulfilment and
willingness to progress as freelancers. Moreover, the more each lower-level need is
satisfied, the more the next higher-level need is satisfied. The results indicate that the
freelancers are a diversified group, and they do not necessarily follow a hierarchy in
fulfilling the needs.

The Sri Lankan marine dried fish sector significantly contributes to the country’s
economy, livelihoods, and well-being of fishing communities. Nevertheless, these
individuals who own and operate dried fish processing businesses function in aresource-
constrained environment shaped by external shocks and internal stressors. Despite these
resource constraints, some Dried Fish Processing Business Operators (DBOs) have
managed to survive and grow their businesses. The study aimed to investigate the types
of Entrepreneurial Decision-Making (EDM) approaches adopted by DBOs, and whether
the EDM types change with the characteristics of business owners and their businesses.
In doing so, the study drew on three different concepts ofEDM approaches—causation,
bricolage, and effectuation. The research was conducted in fishing communities in
Negombo area. The research employed mixed methods including a questionnaire survey
with DBOs (n=86) and in-depth interviews with a subset of the sample (n=20). Data were
analyzed using statistical tests (MANOVA andANOVA) and were supplemented with
insights emerged through qualitative data. Thefindings revealed that DBOs adopted all
three EDM approaches to different degrees. The results further revealed that these
approaches significantly vary with the age and gender of DBOs as well as stage of
operation, and size of their businesses (P&lt;0.05). In particular, younger owners highly
adopt effectuation while older owners highly adopt causation. In contrast, younger-
female DBOs adopt both effectuation and bricolage. Additionally, experienced owners
rely more on the causation approach. Moreover, the findings related to business
characteristics showed that effectuation and bricolage approaches are common in small-
scale businesses and start-ups, whereas large-scale and developed businesses adopt
causation approach. The findings of the study suggestthat policies and interventions that
seek to improve dried fish businesses should pay attention to the diversity among DBOs
and their approaches to sustain their business by going beyond the usual loan facilities
towards business development.

This study, in essence, is an attempt to determine the impact of changes in regulatory,
economic, and business environment on the value chain of the Crop Protection and
Planting Material (CPPM) division, Hayleys Agriculture. In addition to this primary
objective, identifying the effective management practices and modifications in the value
chain that maintains positive revenue growth in a turbulent environment are reviewed.
The applied methodology of this study is focused on the value chain performance
attributes such as efficiency, flexibility, and quality. The ultimate goal is the
identification of the critical success factors which help to maintain successful business
operations of the CPPM division under the uncertain business environment within Sri
Lanka. In-depth interviews were used for data collection. Data was collected directly
from the 14 key informants who employed in functional and middle level management
of the CPPM Division of Hayleys Agriculture. Qualitative research techniques were used
for this case study. In the end, the BCG matrix and McKinsey matrix were developed to
identify competitive advantage. CPPM division managed the crisis effect thorough value
chain transformation. Continuous improvements in different aspects of value chain
components could help to survive in drastically changing market place. Several
recommendations could be obtained from the study. CPPM division should develop the
following areas to improve internal processes: risk management, customer relationship
management, web app optimization, and data visualization across the organization to fit
the technology driven modern business world. Further investments in the development
of the agro chemical and seed vegetable product portfolios and scaling down the seed
paddy business are essential. Important implications could be derived from the study
concerning the management of agri-businesses. It is evident that advanced planning and
long-term oriented strategy formulation offer a good foundation for the firm to operate
under uncertain economic, regulatory, and business environment.

Media planners are facing challenges in budgeting marketing communication with the
changing media consumption behaviour due to power outages, especially during media
prime time. The nature of such behavioural changes may vary depending on
independent viewer characteristics. Hence it is vital to investigate such behavioural
changes and associated characteristics of media consumers for efficient and effective
marketing communication during the power outage. The objectives of the current study
were; to determine the changes in inter and intra-media consumption behaviour
concerning age, socio-economic conditions and different needs (Uses and gratification
theory) under power outages. The population was registered voters from the Western
province's electoral registry, and the sample consisted of 384 respondents selected
randomly. Primary data were collected through face-to-face interviews guided by a pre-
tested structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression
were used to analyze data and achieve research objectives. The findings revealed that
a considerable amount of media consumers had changed their inter/intra media
consumption behaviour with media gratifications, Information seeking, entertainment,
self-expression, and social interaction. Regarding socio-economic and demographic
conditions, age, gender, income, occupation, and district of residence caused the
changes in inter/intra media consumption behaviour during the power outage. The
study further revealed that most media consumers who previously used media,
especially pay TV and non-pay TV during the media prime time, tend to refrain from
using media due to the power outage. Finally, the study found that the change is
significant among frequent media users rather than rare user segments, especially in
non-pay TV and pay TV. Due to these inter/intra media consumption behavioural
changes, media planners should revise the budgets allocated for non-pay TV and pay
TV, especially during the media prime time.

Using plastic mulches in agriculture has a number of advantages. However, plastic
mulching has become a major contributor ofmicroplastics to agriculturallands. This study
was conducted to assess short-term effects of adding microplastics originating from two
types of plastic mulching materials on soil biological properties. The effect of previous
exposure of a soil toplastic mulching on microbial response to microplastics was also
assessed. Two soils, one with previous exposure to plastic mulching (WH) and one
without previous exposure to plastic mulching (NH), collected from MahaIluppallama,
were used for the study. Each soil was mixed with microplastics from a biodegradableand
a conventional mulch at a rate of 0.1%(w/w) separately in triplicates. Unamended soils
served as controls. Soils were incubated in dark for nine weeks after applying treatments.
Soil microbial respiration, microbial biomass carbon, catalase and urease enzyme
activities, soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured periodically. Surface
properties of microplastics before adding to soil and after incubating with soil were
analyzed with FTIR technique. Soil pH and EC increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) in the
microplastic added treatments compared to control at the end of 9th week of incubation.
Microplastic treated soils showed a significantly (P &lt;0.05) lesser degree of enzyme
activity than controls at the end of 9th week. Microplastics from biodegradable mulch
reduced catalase activity more than the conventional mulch. Microbial biomass carbon
and microbial respiration were significantly (P &lt;0.05) changed by microplastic
application. Soils with previous exposure to microplastics significantly affect the changes
in pH, EC, urease activity and soil respiration responding to new input of microplastics.
The study confirmed that addition of microplastics changed soil microbiological
properties. Previous exposure of soil for plastic mulching and the type of mulches
influenced the nature of response of soil microbial communities to new inputs of
microplastics.

Policymakers and university administration are equally concerned about how the current
crisis is affecting student wellbeing. Undergraduates find themselves in stressful
situations because of their workload and other responsibilities. Mental health symptoms
(MHS) are seen as major causes of reduced QOL. This research is conducted to assess
the QOL and the presence of MHS, such as depression, anxiety and stress among
undergraduates and to determine how MHS are associated with QOL. Social and
institutional support systems that are used by undergraduate students was also
investigated. To measure QOL across four domains; physical, psychological, social, and
environment, the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)
was utilised. The existence of MHS was examined using the 21-item Depression,
Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The QOL, MHS, and support services of 471
University of Peradeniya undergraduate students were evaluated using quantitative
research techniques and a deductive approach. Data were collected through both online
(271 responses) and physical (200 responses) modes. Preliminary analysis indicated that
online and physical survey data were not compatible and could not be merged. Therefore,
the analyses were conducted on the two groups separately. Descriptive analyses showed
that most undergraduates had favourable levels of QOL and normal level of MHS.
However, a concerning 15% claimed to have severe and extremely severe levels of
depression, anxiety and stress. MANOVA analysis revealed that QOL and MHS are
significantly associated (p&lt;0.05). Descriptive and tabular analysis showed that QOL
reduced with the increment of severity of MHS. Support systems that were used by a
majority of undergraduates were informal, such as family, batchmates and outside
friends. Only a low percentage of undergraduates sought help from university and other
formal support systems. Findings can inform ways to improve QOL and mental health of
undergraduates.

This study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and health-related aspects
of artificial fruit ripening among fruit vendors and consumers in selected suburbs in mid-
country, Sri Lanka. The study adopted a questionnaire survey. The individual effect and
associations between awareness and respondents’ demographic characteristics were
statistically analyzed. In case of vendors, most of the respondents belonged to the age
category 36-55 years (55%), gender category male (90%), and educational category GCE
A/L (41%). For consumers, most of the respondents belonged to the age category 18-35
years, the gender category female, the educational category GCE A/L, and prefer to
purchase local fruits. Each respondent was given a score and divided into 3 awareness
categories. The awareness of the scientific knowledge, application methods, and health
effects of artificial fruit ripening was evaluated. Most of the vendors (62%) were aware
of the artificial fruit ripening application methods more than consumers (47%). Most of
the vendors (95%) were more aware of the health problems than the consumers (49%).
More consumers (85%) were aware of the science behind artificial fruit ripening than the
vendors (12%). In relation to the vendors, the gender and education categories showed
associations between awareness of artificial fruit ripening and socio-demographic
characteristics. According to the consumers, there were no associations between
consumers’ socio-demographic characteristics and their awareness of artificial fruit
ripening.

With the ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka, people are in a dire struggle to
meet their daily household food requirements. There is a lack of evidence-based
information on the actual status of food insecurity among marginalized
populations of the country. Study, with reference to an economically marginalized
urban community in the Kandy district, attempted to provide an insight into the
extent to which such urban communities are vulnerable to food insecurity in the
face of persistent food price inflation in Sri Lanka. The study was conducted in
the Mahaiyawa MC block of the Poornawatta West GN division. Hundred and ten
households were randomly extracted for the survey. Study attempted to assess the
scope and severity of food insecurity of the households in the target population.
Next, the study attempted to investigate any association between different socio-
demographic factors and the severity of food insecurity pertaining to the study
population. Finally, the study examined the coping responses of the households
in the face of increasing food prices and their declining food purchasing power.
According to the results, 82.5% of the Mahaiyawa MC population is moderately
or severely vulnerable to household food insecurity. Study revealed that
households headed by less-educated or female adults are significantly more
vulnerable to food insecurity than the rest. Study reports a drastic reduction in the
daily intake of essential food groups by the households of the study population.
A number of strategies employed by the households to cope with rising food
prices were revealed. Increased household food production, decreased quality and
quantity of daily meals, changed food purchasing patterns, and reduced food
waste were among the changes triggered by such coping strategies.

Relationship between Water Access, Exogenous Prices, and Poverty of
Farm Households in a Surface-Gravity Irrigation System: The Case Study
of the Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project

Irrigation is vital as a common pool resource in increasing agricultural production.
Farmers mostly use surface irrigation as their method of irrigation. Kirindi Oya Irrigation
and Settlement Project (KOISP) is a major surface gravity irrigation system in the
Hambantota District where priority is given to rice cultivation. Currently, its farmers
leave paddy farming due to their low income. This study first analyses inequality in the
water received by farmers and its relationship with household income and then the effect
of exogenous prices and water access on farmers’ poverty status. The theoretical basis is
the model of profit-maximising farm households. Using published data on the KOISP,
descriptive statistics, farm budget techniques, FGT indices and binary logistic regression
were used for the analysis. Findings indicate substantial differences in water quantity
received by the farmers across seasons and subareas of the system (P&lt;0.05). Around 60%
of farmers show poor water access in Maha and Yala seasons in the New Irrigation Area
(NIA). The average water quantity received in the Old Irrigated Area (OIA) was 17%
higher than the NIA. The changes in household income were simulated by allocating
additional water to fulfil the minimum requirement of the rice plant in its vegetative stage.
Household income increases with every unit of additional water received (P&lt;0.05). The
result of the binary logistic regression indicates that the water access (P&lt;0.05), exogenous
prices; agrochemicals (P&lt;0.05); machinery (P&lt;0.05), seeds (P&lt;0.05) and rice (P&lt;0.05)
significantly influence the probability that a household will be poor or non-poor.
Additional water allocation caused an apparent reduction in the poverty status of farmers
in NIA. Changes to exogenous prices caused a distinct reduction in poverty in both
seasons of the current period (2020/21), which was more prominent in Maha. However,
the number of poor households was higher in OIA than in NIA.

Assessment of water resources and water productivity enables in identifying approaches
to address the agricultural water demand and water scarcity in dry zone of Sri Lanka.
This study was undertaken to assess water resources, analyze and map water productivity
in Malwathu-Oya West Sub Catchment using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
The Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI) was derived by using daily rainfall data for the period
of 1989-2018 from Anuradhapura and Mahagalkadawala rain gauging stations to
identify wet (2015), dry (2016) and normal (2017) years for the analysis. Monthly Net
primary production (NPP) and Actual evapotranspiration and interception (AETI) data
gathered from WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access Remotely sensed
derived data) database of the FAO were used for the water productivity analysis and
mapping. The total water availability for 2018 Yala and 2018/19 Maha seasons were
estimated using a simple water balance method and water demand for different sectors
was estimated. Spatial and temporal variabilities of Gross Paddy Water Productivity
(GPWP) were identified in the analysis. The highest GPWP was reported in 2015, which
identified as a wet year and this condition was evident in Maha seasons compared to Yala
seasons of each year because of relatively high water availability. Hence the study
revealed that GPWP values are synchronized with the rainfall. The ancient tank cascade
systems (Mahakanumulla, Thirappne, Ulagalla) show high GPWP even in Yala seasons
possibly due to better water management practices applied by the farmers. According to
the water resources assessment, there is a water shortage of 42.85 million cubic meters
(MCM) during Yala season even in the normal rainfall year of 2018. As per the water
resources assessment, the estimated water demand for domestic, commercial, industrial
and irrigation are 3.24, 0.39, 7.73 ×10-5 and 100.02 MCM in 2018 Yala season and 4.66,
0.56, 1.06 ×10-4 and 114.16 MCM in 2018/19 Maha season. Irrigation sector is the largest
water user. The spatial variability of paddy water productivity in this area could be
minimized through appropriate interventions to improve paddy production.

Jaffna is one of the largest Districts in the Northern Province which has good potentialfor
farming activities. Valikaamam south area is one of the most dynamic divisional
secretariats in terms of females seeking employment. The study was undertaken among
women in the Valikaamam South. Women play a significant and crucial role in farming,
non-farming, and household activities. Several economic and non-economic factors are
responsible for women's participation in the labor force. However, the levelof women's
participation in farming and non-farming activities is often associated withrelatively low
participation rates. This study focuses on how women's participation rate varies with
women’s demographic and household characteristics, factors related to farming and non-
farming, the role of women’s society, and issues such as disturbances,gender gap, and less
productivity. The study also focuses on what are the factors influencing the decision to
engage in women's participation in farm and non-farm activities and investigates the
issues faced by women in the vicinity of the ValikaamamSouth. A total of 87 households
were selected through proportionate random sampling through the Vali-South Grama
Niladari division by using pre-tested well-structured questionnaires. Heckman’s two-
sample model was employed to identify the factors thatinfluence women in the labor force
as well as factors that influence the decision to engage in income-generating activities.
Results showed that education level with A/L, graduate, higher studies, the motive to
work, and training significantly influence the wage earned per month. On the other hand,
age significantly influences the decision toengage in the labor force. The results imply
stronger policy interventions targeted at women to improve and increase their
participation in the labor force.

An Analysis of Potential Effects of Alternative Urea Rationing Options on
Paddy Yields and Production in Sri Lanka
Ihalagedara I.H.C.N.K. and Weerahewa J.*
Department of Agricultural Economics and Business Management,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
Restriction of imports of chemical fertilizers in the midst of the economic crisis of Sri
Lanka has caused serious effects on its agricultural production. Even after the lifting of
the import ban on chemical fertilizers, provision of urea was inadequate to fulfil farmer
demand. As a result, urea became a scarce resource for the paddy farmers. This study
analyses potential effects of alternative urea rationing methods on paddy production in
Sri Lanka. The specific objectives are to estimate the technical relationship between the
paddy production and the usage of raw materials paying special emphasis on urea and to
examine the potential to enhance paddy production by allocating limited amount of urea
available, among different types of paddy farmers. Data gathered from an island-wide
survey conducted among 439 paddy farmers was used for the analysis. Several
production functions were estimated in Cobb-Douglas form treating paddy yield as the
dependent variable. Even though the results of the estimation showed a positive
relationship between paddy yield and urea, a decline in marginal product of paddy with
respect to urea was observed when land size increases. These results suggest a higher
response to urea among small and medium scale farmers compared to those of large
farmers. The simulation analysis performed to ascertain the changes in yields and total
production under alternative urea rationing schemes clearly showed significant adverse
effects of a blanket reduction of urea on yield as well as total production of small and
medium size paddy lands. Accordingly, a higher production was observed when available
urea was rationed prioritizing small and medium paddy lands. It is recommended to ration
urea prioritizing small and medium category farmers to enhance production of paddy
using limited quantity of urea available.

Paddy cultivation is one of the most important sector in Sri Lanka. Now a day’s
cultivation needs various types of machineries to perform several kind of farming
activities such as land preparation, harvesting and other crop production practices.
Therefore, a huge amount of fuel is consumed every year by agricultural sector. Due to
the fuel crisis, it brought scarcity and price increasement on fuel. Fuel scarcity effects to
perform paddy farming activities in perfect level and appropriate period of time. Fuel
price hike effects on the input cost of paddy farming. This focused on the fuel scarcity
due to the crisis. The study analyses how people struggle to get fuel and how fuel price
hike changed the input cost of paddy farming before and after fuel crisis. This study based
on Thoppur division paddy cultivation which includes 12 GN divisions in Trincomalee
district. Paddy farmer in Thoppur area was taken as the unit of analysis. Primary data
were collected from 35 farmers using structured questionnaire and face to face
interviews. Paired t test was performed to compare before and after effects of fuel crisis.
The effect of fuel crisis on paddy cultivation in Thoppur division was tested and there are
significant differences due to fuel crisis before and after, in the factors such as spending
hours in fuel station, number of trips to fuel station, travel distance from home, received
amount of fuel, paddy cultivated area and number of rice plot cultivated than the input
prices on paddy cultivation due to fuel crisis. There is a significant relationship in land
preparation cost and harvesting amount of paddy before and after fuel crisis but there is
no such relationship in harvesting cost and labor cost. Finally, the coping strategies
followed by farmers to overcome this fuel crisis were analyzed.

Postgraduate students (PGS) are students who have obtained a degree from a university
and are pursuing studies for a more advanced qualification. PGS have to fulfill multiple
roles associated with their academic, work and family lives. Multiple roles cause stress
and a lack of work-life balance (WLB). This may lower the quality of life (QoL) of PGS.
Therefore, it is aimed to examine students’ QoL and WLB; to study the effect of WLB
on QoL of PGS and to determine the impact of gender and marital status as moderators
on the relationship between WLB and QoL. The World Health Organization QoL BREF
(WHOQOL-BREF) model was used to conceptualize QoL with four domains and the
model proposed by Fisher McAuley was used to conceptualize WLB with the three
domains, work interference with personal life (w2p), personal life interference with work
(p2w) and work-personal life enhancement (enhance). The primarily quantitative study
was conducted with 250 PGS belonging to all four postgraduate institutes at University
of Peradeniya (UoP) as participants. Data were collected through an online questionnaire
using a census approach. A follow-up qualitative study was conducted to further
understand how PGS experienced WLB. Descriptive analyses revealed that PGS at UoP
had relatively high QoL in all domains. Structural equation modeling revealed that there
was a significant positive effect of WLB on QoL (P&lt;0.05). Moderation analysis revealed
that there was no significant moderating effect of gender on the relationship between
WLB and QoL (P>0.05). The marital status (married with children) compared to
unmarried ones, had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between the first
two WLB domains (w2p and p2w) and QoL (P&lt;0.05). Follow-up qualitative analysis
revealed that many PGS (33.33%) plan successfully to balance their career, studies and
personal lives to have a better balance. Implications of the study are discussed.

Agriculture has been at the forefront as Sri Lanka has tried to address the effects of the
ongoing economic crisis. Therefore, Agricultural undergraduates have a role to play in
addressing the crisis. This research aims to study the career preferences of Agricultural
undergraduates during the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. Social Cognitive Career Theory
(SCCT) was used to conceptualize the factors that affect career preferences. In addition,
the effect of demographic factors on career preferences has been explored. Mixed
methods, both quantitative and qualitative methods, were used on a sample of 269
Agricultural undergraduates of the University of Peradeniya, University of Ruhuna,
Wayamba University of Sri Lanka, and Uva-Wellassa University. Data were gathered
through an online questionnaire survey. Descriptive analyses showed that the majority of
the participants changed their career preferences during the economic crisis compared to
pre-crisis preferences, the main concerns were the lack of hiring into the public sector,
market instability and uncertainty, and the desire to leave the country. A majority of
students preferred the private sector for their careers after the economic crisis set in. Path
analysis was conducted to find the effects of constructs of SCCT and demographic factors
on the career preferences of Agricultural undergraduates. Path analysis revealed that self-
efficacy and contextual supports significantly affect the outcome expectations of the
career (P&lt;0.05) and self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and gender of the participants
significantly affect the components of career preferences: the knowledge of possibilities
and the trust in future career paths (P&lt;0.05). Contextual barriers and monthly income
significantly affect goal clarity (P&lt;0.05). Contextual supports significantly affect both
components of career preferences (P&lt;0.05). Self-efficacy and gender did not significantly
affect goal clarity (P>0.05). The findings of this study can be used by the university
administration, career counselors, and policymakers when organizing career guidance
programs for Agricultural undergraduates.

Department of Agricultural Economics and Business Management,
Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka
With the banning of imports of chemical fertilizer in May 2021, all crop cultivations were
disrupted due to insufficiency of application of plant nutrients. This study was conducted
to ascertain the extent to which paddy farmers adopted to use of organic fertilizers and to
determine the factors determining organic and chemical fertilizer use paying attention to
the decision to use organic fertilizers, quantities of fertilizer applied, and willingness to
pay for fertilizers. Data collected from 463 farmers on the fertilizer application pattern in
the Maha seasons of 2020/21, 2021/22, and 2022/23 was used for the analysis. Mean and
frequency distributions were used to show the fertilizer pattern and regression models
were used to determine the factors affecting fertilizer use decisions. The results indicated
that 6.7%, 46.43%, and 39.09% of farmers used organic fertilizer. The result indicated
that less educated farmers, having less land size, and part-time farmers are highly
significant than that of highly educated farmers, having a large land size, and full-time
farmers. For, the use of chemical fertilizers, females, not in a farming organization,
educated farmer, and have less land size are significantly higher than males, members of
farmer organization, less educated farmers, and have large land size. If a sudden policy
change will happen in the future, can consider these variables and provide more priority
to these farmers’ characteristics without disturbing the paddy production in the country.

Farmer Attitude and Adaptation to Climate Change ResilientApproaches:
A Study from Ihalapalukandewa GN Division.

One of the biggest challenges to increasing or even maintaining food production by
small-holder farming groups in a nation is climate change. Climate change is one of the
biggest issues in Sri Lanka because the country is heavily dependent on agriculture,which
is the foundation of rural livelihoods and is based on natural resources. Scientists have
suggested that Sri Lanka's overall rainfall, its known patterns, and the distributionlooks to
be changing. Adaptation to climate change resilient strategies increase agricultural
productivity and build farmers’ resilience simultaneously. In this study, I investigate how
smallholder farmers in the Ihalapalukandewa GN division, adapt to climate change.
Primary data was collected and analyzed using a multivariate probit model. To measure
the attitude of farmers, a Likert scale was used to obtain an averagescore and a deviation
from the average to measure attitude. To identify constraints, a Likert scale was used to
construct a Problem Confrontation Index where ranking was done. According to the
results, some adaptation strategies (using organic fertilizer andrainwater harvesting) are
interdependent. The use of organic fertilizer and rainwater harvesting allows farmers to
increase productivity while building resilience to climate change. The likelihood of
farmers’ adaptation to climate change resilient approaches depends on the education of
farmers, land size, access to extension services, and creditservices, and membership in
farmer organizations. Although most of the farmers have a favorable attitude towards
climate change and resilient approaches, lack of availablewater, shortage of farm inputs,
lack of credit or money, and inadequate extension officers are the major problems in
adapting climate resilient strategies. According to the findings of this study, governments
should concentrate on supporting relevant infrastructure development, empowering
access to extension services, and enabling cost-effective access to agricultural supplies
either directly or through credit market interventions.

Why Choose to Shop Physically rather than Online for Purchasing Fresh
Produce? A Study of Brick-and-Mortar Shoppers
in Battaramulla Shopping Strip

Although traditional shoppers must travel to retail outlets to purchase fresh produce, they
can purchase the produce from the convenience of their homes through online platforms.
Yet online purchasing rates for fresh produce remain low. This research examines why
customers physically visit brick-and-mortar supermarkets. It also examines the extent to
which fresh produce is bought online relative to other productsand services, and changes
in the use of online retail outlets before, during, and after theCOVID pandemic. Finally,
the study explores the reasons for not engaging in purchasing online fresh produce, and
identifies the key determinants affecting attitudestowards the intention of purchasing fresh
produce online. The conceptual model is builton the Technology Acceptance Model and
Theory of Reasoned Action. First, a preliminary study was conducted to develop the
questionnaire within the Battaramullashopping strip, the study site. In the main study,
using an exit poll method, 218 consumers behaviours and perceptions were studied.
Results indicate that onlinepurchasing of fresh produce is lower relative to rates of use of
online platforms for banking, purchasing of food and beverages, and textiles. During the
COVID-19pandemic, the percentage who used online platforms was higher compared to
before or after the pandemic. The reasons for not purchasing online were related to
technologicaland quality issues. Hierarchical linear regression analyses on attitudes and
intention topurchase online, demonstrated significant effects for age, educational level,
occupation, and family size. Further of the variables related to purchasing behaviour only
whether online purchasing was done during the COVID-19 lockdown period was
significant, and of the attitudinal variables, personal awareness of security, personal
innovativeness, and perceived ease of use were predictive (p &lt; 0.05). Using these findings
e-grocers, retailers can develop better marketing and virtual platforms to develop better
online services for their customers

Risks faced by supply chain actors is a major constraint for the development of the supply
chain. In improving supply chains, it is important to know the different kinds of risks
faced and their relative importance. This study assesses the different types of risks as
perceived by the supply chain actors in the fruits supply chain in Vavuniya district. A
supply chain actor was interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The actors upstream
and downstream of the supply chain were identified starting from the fresh fruit retails
shops in Vavuniya town. The data were gathered from 9 farmers, 3 collectors, 3
wholesalers, 9 retailers, 9 consumers. The data were analysed using Fuzzy – Analytical
Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP). The rating was considered valid, when its consistency
ratio (CR) value lesser than 0.10. The results revealed that the actors involved in the fresh
fruit supply chain are affected by different risks. The highest risk perceived at the retailer
and customer levels is the price risk, and its CR values are 0.0057 and 0.0243,
respectively. Wholesalers perceived transportation risk and customer loyalty and default
risk as the main risks, and its CR value is 0.0059. Collectors perceived transportation risk
as the main risk and, its CR value is 0.0119. Farmers perceived price risk and the supply
risk of inputs as main risks and, its CR value is 0.0131. Risk managing strategies
proposed by supply chain actors include reducing prices to increase number of buyers,
collectively use transport facilities, have good storage facilities, understanding the daily
demand for fresh fruits, giving a discount on low quality fruits, purchasing the entire fruit
requirement at once to cut down on transport and storage costs, sharing information with
buyers and sellers, understanding climate change and precautions, trading with buyers
and sellers in the nearby areas during fuel crisis, and diversifying to different products
